# Setup
  First make sure your modules are the right version (check out requirements.txt).
  
  NOTE: We are using python 3 throughout

## Downloading Data

  * Download the 5\_wikipedia data set from:
      https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bw3qoCCWu7Mfbldlb1dvUHZ4UHM

  * Download the pre-trained GloVe vectors from:
      http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

## Data directories

  Data paths are customizable using `global_config.py`, but default locations are:

  *  `5_wikipedia` data set goes into `data/5_wikipedia`

  * Pre-trained GloVe vectors go into `data/glove`
  
# Training a Model

  For every `model.py` there's a corresponding `trainer.py`
  
  Simply run:
  ```	
    $ python3 trainer.py
  ```
  and you will train the model and evaluate it using the test data.

  CNN trainer offers flags where you can chose to restore from a previous run, and whether to
  train, test, and/or predict.

  One example is:
  ```
    $ cd cnn
    $ python3 trainer.py --restore latest --no-train --no-test --predict
  ```
  Which uses the latest trained model, predicts on a subset of the test data and prints out the predictions
