"Hot Rod Race" is a Western swing song about an automobile race out of San Pedro, California, between a Ford and a Mercury. Released in November 1950, it broke the ground for a series of hot rod songs recorded for the car culture of the 1950s and 60s. With its hard driving boogie woogie beat, it is sometimes named one of the first rock and roll songs.
Written by George Wilson, it became a major hit for Arkie Shibley and his Mountain Dew Boys (Gilt-Edge 5021), staying on the charts for 7 weeks, peaking at #5 in 1951. Trying to repeat his success, Shibley recorded at least four follow-up songs.
Ramblin' Jimmie Dolan, Tiny Hill, and Red Foley, all released versions in 1951; Hill's version reached #7 on the Country charts and # 29 on the pop charts.
Shibley's record may have climbed higher and outpaced any of the others, but his second verse opened up with:

Now along about the middle of the night
We were ripping along like white folks might.Eastern radio stations, never a fan of Western swing anyway, refused to play it.Dolan changed the verse to say "plain folks"; Hill to "rich folks"; and Foley to "poor folks".
The song ends with:

When it flew by us, I turned the other way.
The guy in Mercury had nothing to say,
For it was a kid, in a hopped-up Model A.
These lyics set the stage for an "answer song" called "Hot Rod Lincoln", first recorded in 1955.

ProFIT-MAP is a business methodology for improving organizational performance and managing execution. Its objective is to help organizations achieve their cost and operational targets. It does this by identifying the relevant parameters that managers can control, linking them to the business objectives, showing which changes will be effective, and creating an execution roadmap that will achieve the objectives.
For any business improvement challenge, ProFIT-MAP answers four important management questions. Managers then use this information as an input into their decision making process.

 Can it be done? Is it possible? If not, then what additional capabilities are needed?
 Will it be profitable?
 What is the impact of my decision across the product mix and the functional capabilities of the organization?
 How do I transform operations from point A to point B? That is, what is the operational roadmap for achieving the business objectives?

Neural machine translation (NMT) is the approach to machine translation in which a large neural network is trained to maximize translation performance. It is a radical departure from the phrase-based statistical translation approaches, in which a translation system consists of subcomponents that are separately optimized.The artificial neural network (ANN) is a model inspired by the functional aspects and structure of the brain’s biological neural networks. With use of ANN, it is possible to execute a number of tasks, such as classification, clustering, and prediction, using machine learning techniques like supervised or reinforced learning to learn or adjust net connections.
A bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN), known as an encoder, is used by the neural network to encode a source sentence for a second RNN, known as a decoder, that is used to predict words in the target language.NMT models are inspired by deep representation learning. They require only a fraction of the memory needed by traditional statistical machine translation (SMT) models.  Furthermore, unlike conventional translation systems, each and every component of the neural translation model is trained jointly to maximize the translation performance.
When a new neural network is created, it is trained for certain domains or applications. Once an automatic learning mechanism is established, the network practices. With time it starts operating according to its own judgment, turning into an "expert".

The International Communist League (LCI) was a Trotskyist political party in Vietnam.  It was founded as the October Group in 1932, by a split in the Indochinese Bolshevik-Leninist Group, which also produced the Struggle Group.  The group acquired its name from its journal, Thang muoi (October).
The October Group supported but did not join La Lutte, a united front of the Struggle Group and the Indochinese Communist Party (PCI), as it would have had to withhold its criticisms of the PCI.
The October Group grew rapidly and began publishing a newspaper, Le Militant.  This was suppressed by the colonial government in 1937 for supporting strikes.  As a result, they again began publishing October, along with a new newspaper, Tia Sang, which in 1939 became a daily - perhaps the world's first daily Trotskyist newspaper.
With the outbreak of World War II, the leading figures in the group were arrested and the organisation banned.  Activity did not resume until August 1944, when it was renamed the "International Communist League".
The LCI fully supported the workers' uprising against colonial rule at the end of the war.  It organised committees to take power in over 150 towns.  Its membership grew rapidly, and it was able to establish printing presses.  However, an attempt to organise an assembly of the committees in Saigon was broken up by Chief of Police Duong Bach Mai with the support of the PCI.
When a French expeditionary force arrived, the LCI organised a workers' militia, but its appeal for workers to arm themselves was not widely taken up.  Ho Chi Minh of the PCI signed an agreement with the French, and the most of the leaders of the LCI were executed or had disappeared by early 1946.

In number theory, primes in arithmetic progression are any sequence of at least three prime numbers that are consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression. For example, the sequence of primes (3, 7, 11), which is given by <math>a_n = 3 + 4n</math> for <math>0 \le n \le 2</math>.
According to the Green–Tao theorem, there exist arbitrarily long sequences of primes in arithmetic progression. Sometimes the phrase may also be used about primes which belong to an arithmetic progression which also contains composite numbers. For example, it can be used about primes in an arithmetic progression of the form <math>an + b</math>, where a and b are coprime which according to Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions contains infinitely many primes, along with infinitely many composites.
For integer k ≥ 3, an AP-k (also called PAP-k) is any sequence of k primes in arithmetic progression. An AP-k can be written as k primes of the form a·n + b, for fixed integers a (called the common difference) and b, and k consecutive integer values of n. An AP-k is usually expressed with n = 0 to k − 1. This can always be achieved by defining b to be the first prime in the arithmetic progression.

The Smith Commission was announced by Prime Minister David Cameron on 19 September 2014 in the wake of the 'No' vote in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. The establishment of the commission was part of the process of fulfilling 'The Vow' made by the leaders of the three main unionist parties during the last days of the referendum campaign. The Vow promised the devolution of more powers from the United Kingdom parliament to the Scottish parliament in the event of a No vote.
Following the No vote, Lord Smith of Kelvin was given the task to "convene cross-party talks and facilitate an inclusive engagement process across Scotland to produce, by 30 November 2014, Heads of Agreement with recommendations for further devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament". Ten representatives were nominated by the political parties with elected members in the Scottish Parliament; the Commission started its discussions on 22 October. Agreement was reached and the report published on 27 November 2014.
Following the Conservative election victory at the 2015 UK General Election, the Scotland Bill 2015–16 was proposed in the first Queen's Speech, to put into effect the recommendations of the Smith Commission.

In signal processing, a polyphase matrix is a matrix whose elements are filter masks.  It represents a filter bank as it is used in sub-band coders alias discrete wavelet transforms.If <math>\scriptstyle h,\, g</math> are two filters, then one level the traditional wavelet transform maps an input signal <math>\scriptstyle a_0</math> to two output signals <math>\scriptstyle a_1,\, d_1</math>, each of the half length:

<math>\begin{align} a_1 &= (h\cdot a_0) \downarrow 2 \\
 d_1 &= (g\cdot a_0) \downarrow 2

\end{align}</math>
Note, that the dot means polynomial multiplication; i.e., convolution and <math>\scriptstyle\downarrow</math> means downsampling.
If the above formula is implemented directly, you will compute values that are subsequently flushed by the down-sampling.  You can avoid their computation by splitting the filters and the signal into even and odd indexed values before the wavelet transformation:

<math>\begin{array}{rclcrcl} h_{\mbox{e}} &=& h \downarrow 2 &\qquad& a_{0,\mbox{e}} &=& a_0 \downarrow 2 \\
 h_{\mbox{o}} &=& (h \leftarrow 1) \downarrow 2 && a_{0,\mbox{o}} &=& (a_0 \leftarrow 1) \downarrow 2

\end{array}</math>
The arrows <math>\scriptstyle\leftarrow</math> and <math>\scriptstyle\rightarrow</math> denote left and right shifting, respectively.  They shall have the same precedence like convolution, because they are in fact convolutions with a shifted discrete delta impulse.

<math>\delta = (\dots, 0, 0, \underset{0-\mbox{th position}}{1}, 0, 0, \dots)</math>The wavelet transformation reformulated to the split filters is:

<math>\begin{align} a_1 &= h_{\mbox{e}}\cdot a_{0,\mbox{e}} +
        h_{\mbox{o}}\cdot a_{0,\mbox{o}} \rightarrow 1 \\
 d_1 &= g_{\mbox{e}}\cdot a_{0,\mbox{e}} +
        g_{\mbox{o}}\cdot a_{0,\mbox{o}} \rightarrow 1

\end{align}</math>
This can be written as matrix-vector-multiplication

<math>\begin{align} P &= \begin{pmatrix}
         h_{\mbox{e}} & h_{\mbox{o}} \rightarrow 1 \\
         g_{\mbox{e}} & g_{\mbox{o}} \rightarrow 1
       \end{pmatrix} \\
 \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ d_1 \end{pmatrix} &= P \cdot
       \begin{pmatrix}
         a_{0,\mbox{e}} \\
         a_{0,\mbox{o}}
       \end{pmatrix}

\end{align}</math>
This matrix <math>\scriptstyle P</math> is the polyphase matrix.

Of course, a polyphase matrix can have any size, it need not to have square shape.  That is, the principle scales well to any filterbanks, multiwavelets, wavelet transforms based on fractional refinements.

The Estudiantina waltz, or Band of Students Waltz is a musical arrangement, made in 1883, by Emile Waldteufel, which would be his Opus 191, No. 4. Its melody was composed earlier in 1881 by Paul Lacome, with lyrics by J. de Lau Lusignan.
Waldteufel first adapted it to a two-piano version, and later to an orchestral version with which classical music audiences are familiar today. The main melody is universally recognized by Americans of a certain age as the Rheingold Beer jingle, with the words "My beer is Rheingold the dry beer. Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer. It's not bitter, not sweet, it's the extra dry treat—Won't you try extra dry Rheingold beer?". And in Germany the main melody is very popular because of a song called "Spaniens Gitarren" sung by the singers Cindy & Bert in 4/4 time which was a great hit for them in 1974.

The waltz does not have the extended introduction so often favoured by Waldteufel and begins instead with a brief fanfare which announces the waltz's 3/4 time. The refrain is in D major, and is repeated twice. The 2nd section is in G major, with a quiet repetitive note melody followed by a midsection D major part. The 3rd part of the arrangement is in D major, with a contrasting B minor part. The final section is back in G major, this time a quieter part than the previous sections, rounded up by an ebullient chorded phrase. The main introduction is played again, as is the refrain. After a brief reprise of the 2nd section melody in a different key, the refrain is repeated again and the waltz ends on a high-spirited note.

In number theory, natural density (or asymptotic density or arithmetic density) is one  of the possibilities to measure how large a subset of the set of natural numbers is.
Intuitively, it is thought that there are more positive integers than perfect squares, since every perfect square is already positive, and many other positive integers exist besides. However, the set of positive integers is not in fact larger than the set of perfect squares: both sets are infinite and countable and can therefore be put in one-to-one correspondence. Nevertheless if one goes through the natural numbers, the squares become increasingly scarce.  The notion of natural density makes this intuition precise.
If an integer is randomly selected from the interval [1, n], then the probability that it belongs to A is the ratio of the number of elements of A in [1, n] to the total number of elements in [1, n]. If this probability tends to some limit as n tends to infinity, then this limit is referred to as the asymptotic density of A. This notion can be understood as a kind of probability of choosing a number from the set A. Indeed, the asymptotic density (as well as some other types of densities) is studied in probabilistic number theory.
Asymptotic density contrasts, for example, with the Schnirelmann density.
One drawback of asymptotic density is that it is not defined for all subsets of <math>\mathbb{N}</math>.

Curtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975), known professionally as 50 Cent, is an American rapper, actor, businessman, and investor. Born in the South Jamaica neighborhood of the borough of Queens, Jackson began selling drugs at age twelve during the 1980s crack epidemic. Although he left drug-dealing to pursue a musical career, he was struck by nine bullets in a 2000 shooting. After Jackson released the compilation album Guess Who's Back? in 2002, he was discovered by Eminem and signed by Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records.
With the aid of Eminem and Dr. Dre (who produced his first major-label album, Get Rich or Die Tryin'), Jackson became one of the world's best selling rappers and rose to prominence with East Coast hip hop group G-Unit (which he leads de facto). In 2003 he founded G-Unit Records, signing his G-Unit associates Young Buck, Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. Jackson had similar commercial and critical success with his second album, The Massacre, which was released in 2005. He released his fifth studio album, Animal Ambition, in 2014 and is working on his sixth studio album: Street King Immortal. He executive produces the show Power, which airs on Starz.
During his career Jackson has sold over 30 million albums worldwide and won several awards, including a Grammy Award, thirteen Billboard Music Awards, six World Music Awards, three American Music Awards and four BET Awards. He has pursued an acting career, appearing in the semi-autobiographical film Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2005), the Iraq War film Home of the Brave (2006) and Righteous Kill (2008). 50 Cent was ranked the sixth-best artist of the 2000s, the third-best rapper (behind Eminem and Nelly). Rolling Stone consider Get Rich or Die Tryin' and “In Da Club" to be in their lists of “100 Best albums of the 2000s” and “100 Best songs of the 2000s” at numbers 37 and 13.

"3 Words" is a song recorded by English singer Cheryl Cole for her 2009 debut studio album of the same name. It was released in the UK and Ireland on 20 December 2009 by Fascination Records and later in 2010 by Universal Music, sometimes serving as the lead single for 3 Words. The uptempo dance-pop song was written by Cole and George Pajon. It was also written and produced by will.i.am who has guest vocals on the song. 3 Words was cited by Cole as her favourite song from the album for being different from what people expected.
"3 Words" was praised by contemporary critics who said it was "a sophisticated love song" and the "standout track" from the album. Its unconventional production abandons the use of 'verse-chorus-verse' structure instead, opting for a throbbing build up to a climax. The accompanying video, directed by Saam, features the singer in various fashion ensambles often contrasting colour with will.i.am and, paying homage to Madonna. It also makes use of split screen cinematography and camera effects for the transition of scenes.
The song was promoted on Cheryl Cole's Night In. The single was less commercially successful compared to its predecessor "Fight for This Love" but despite not peaking at number one, it went on to become Cole's second consecutive UK top-five and Irish-top ten hit. It was also a top five hit in Australia and has since been certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association and silver by the British Phonographic Industry.

The Yeomen of the Guard; or, The Merryman and His Maid, is a Savoy Opera, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert. It premiered at the Savoy Theatre on 3 October 1888, and ran for 423 performances. This was the eleventh collaboration of fourteen between Gilbert and Sullivan.
The opera is set in the Tower of London, during the 16th century, and is the darkest, and perhaps most emotionally engaging, of the Savoy Operas, ending with a broken-hearted main character and two very reluctant engagements, rather than the usual numerous marriages. The libretto does contain considerable humour, including a lot of pun-laden one-liners, but Gilbert's trademark satire and topsy-turvy plot complications are subdued in comparison with the other Gilbert and Sullivan operas.  The dialogue, though in prose, is quasi-Shakespearian, or early modern English, in style.
Critics considered the score to be Sullivan's finest, including its overture, which is in sonata form, rather than being written as a sequential pot-pourri of tunes from the opera, as in most of the other Gilbert and Sullivan overtures. This was the first Savoy Opera to use Sullivan's larger orchestra, including a second bassoon and third trombone. Most of Sullivan's subsequent operas, including those not composed with Gilbert as librettist, use this larger orchestra.

Europa riconosciuta is an opera in two acts by Antonio Salieri, designated as a dramma per musica, set to an Italian libretto by Mattia Verazi.

The opera takes place in Tyre in Phoenicia and tells a story of love, violence and political discord in ancient times. The central character, Europa, was once the lover of Zeus and helps resolve all disagreements after she discloses her identity - thus the title "Europa Revealed. "  Though a traditional opera seria, the work differentiates itself from several of the typical characteristics of the genre. For example: a murder is seen onstage and an extended finale is used in both acts, a practice more typical of opera buffa. Musically, the opera is quite challenging, requiring four principal singers capable of spanning wide tessituras, sustaining long phrases, and making dextrous leaps. For example, the roles of Europa and Semele go up to a high F sharp above high C a few times and at one point Europa even sings a high G.

SystemVerilog DPI (Direct Programming Interface) is an interface which can be used to interface SystemVerilog with foreign languages. These Foreign languages can be C, C++, SystemC as well as others. DPIs consist of two layers: A SystemVerilog Layer and a Foreign language layer. Both the layers are isolated from each other. Which programming language is actually used as the foreign language is transparent and irrelevant for the System-Verilog side of this interface. Neither the SystemVerilog compiler nor the foreign language compiler is required to analyze the source code in the other’s language. Different programming languages can be used and supported with the same intact SystemVerilog layer. For now, however, SystemVerilog defines a foreign language layer only for the C programming language.
The motivation for this interface is two-fold. The methodological requirement is that the interface should allow a heterogeneous system to be built (a design or a testbench) in which some components can be written in a language (or more languages) other than SystemVerilog, hereinafter called the foreign language. On the other hand, there is also a practical need for an easy and efficient way to connect existing code, usually written in C or C++, without the knowledge and the overhead of PLI or VPI.
DPI follows the principle of a black box: the specification and the implementation of a component are clearly separated, and the actual implementation is transparent to the rest of the system. Therefore, the actual  programming language of the implementation is also transparent, although this standard defines only C linkage semantics. The separation between SystemVerilog code and the foreign language is based on using  functions as the natural encapsulation unit in SystemVerilog. By and large, any function can be treated as a black box and implemented either in SystemVerilog or in the foreign language in a transparent way, without changing its calls.

"Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just as Bad)" (commonly referred to as "Stormy Monday") is a song written and recorded by American blues electric guitar pioneer T-Bone Walker.  It is a slow twelve-bar blues performed in the West Coast blues-style that features Walker's smooth, plaintive vocal and distinctive guitar work.  As well as becoming a record chart hit in 1948, it inspired B.B. King and others to take up the electric guitar.  "Stormy Monday" became Walker's best-known and most-recorded song.
In 1961, Bobby "Blue" Bland further popularized the song with an appearance in the pop record charts.  Bland introduced a new arrangement with chord substitutions, which was later used in many subsequent renditions. His version also incorrectly used the title "Stormy Monday Blues",  which was copied and resulted in royalties being paid to songwriters other than Walker.  The Allman Brothers Band recorded an extended version for their first live album in 1971, with additional changes to the arrangement.  Through the album's popularity and the group's concert performances, they brought "Stormy Monday" to the attention of rock audiences.  Similarly, R&B singer Latimore's 1973 hit recording made it popular with a later R&B audience.

"Stormy Monday" is one of the most popular blues standards, with numerous renditions.  As well as being necessary for blues musicians, it is also found in the repertoires of many jazz, soul, pop, and rock performers.  The song is included in the Grammy, Rock and Roll, and Blues Foundation halls of fame as well as the U.S. Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.

The term PMC is often used to name, derogatively, the collusion between governments or individual politicians and the media industry in an attempt to manipulate rather than inform the people.There is recent evidence to suggest that newer media portals (as opposed to those outlets of "traditional" mainstream media) are turning, more readily, to using the PMC framework in critical analysis and interpretation of media behavior.

The Heart of Ezra Greer is a 1917 American silent drama film produced by the Thanhouser Company and directed by Emile Chautard. The film focuses on Ezra Greer, a successful middle-aged man who searches for his college age daughter, Mary. The wayward Mary was romanced and abandoned by Jack Denbeigh, later bearing his child. Once Ezra becomes broke he finds employment as the valet for Jack Denbeigh. After Jack's engagement to a cabaret girl, Mary becomes upset and leaves her child at Jack's home. Contrary to Jack's wishes, Ezra keeps the child and Jack ultimately reveals that the child is his own. Ezra convinces Jack to make things right and Ezra convinces the cabaret girl to leave Jack. After a carriage accident in which the baby is injured, Ezra and Jack rush to the hospital and find Mary as a nurse crying over the child. The film ends with the marriage of Jack and Mary. The film was released by Pathé on October 7, 1917. The film was the final release from Thanhouser and was deemed to be an average film by most reviewers. Criticism for the film hinged on far-fetched coincidences to drive the plot. The film is presumed lost.

Experimental hip hop, also known as abstract hip hop, is a genre of hip hop that employs structural elements typically considered unconventional in traditional hip hop music. Some notable experimental hip hop record labels include Definitive Jux, Anticon, Big Dada and Ninja Tune. While most experimental hip hop incorporates turntablism and is produced electronically, some artists have introduced acoustic elements to the music to facilitate it being performed live.

Experimental hip hop is typically believed to have originated during hip hop's "golden age",  usually thought of as occurring from the mid 1980s and the mid 1990s, a time that many fans and critics believe that hip hop was at the peak of its diversity, quality, innovation, and influence. As a relatively young musical style, hip hop during this period was about new ideas and experimentation. Fueled by themes of Afrocentricity and political militancy, coupled with experimental music and sampling techniques, led to great of number of stylistic innovations.

A list of concert tours by hard rock band Van Halen.
That on all tours, the band's line-up has featured Eddie Van Halen and Alex Van Halen. Michael Anthony has played bass on all tours through 2004. Since 2007 Eddie's son Wolfgang Van Halen has played bass for the band. The vocalist has changed numerous times, hence the inclusion of a vocalist column in the table. The vocalist column gives dates for the span they toured with the band for - not how long they were in the band for.
Information on early concerts is less reliable, as is to be expected.
All tours undertaken by Van Halen went through the USA, with the exception of the Monsters of Rock Tour 1984. Hawaiian dates have been counted as American, due to its official position as a state of the USA.
The Heavyweight Champs Of Rock 'N Roll Tour of the USA in 2002 was not a Van Halen tour. It was a co-headlining tour by the two former Van Halen vocalists David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar. The tour has a connection to Van Halen, featuring numerous guest appearances by Van Halen's then-bassist Michael Anthony with Hagar on many dates on bass and backing vocals (and occasionally lead vocals), and one date where former Van Halen vocalist Gary Cherone joined the pair for a duet. Nor are Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony's tours as The Other Half (a play on them being "half" of the Van Halen line-up) where the two former members of the band would play Hagar-era Van Halen tunes together with a backing band.

The Lillywhite Sessions (tLWS) is a collection of songs recorded by Dave Matthews Band in 1999 and 2000 and produced by Steve Lillywhite. The songs, recorded by the band as a follow-up to their 1998 album Before These Crowded Streets, were ultimately scrapped by the band's label. Upon being forced by the label to abandon the album-in-progress, Dave Matthews was assigned to work with producer Glen Ballard who, in association with Matthews, wrote the album Everyday in just ten days. This contrasted with the band's prior style of writing, which included significant collaboration between the band members in the studio. The recordings later emerged on the Internet shortly after the release of Everyday, and created controversy among fans as well as the music industry, which was early in its campaign to curb illegal file downloads. The Lillywhite Sessions were never officially released, but most of the songs were later recorded for their 2002 album Busted Stuff.

Change of Habit is a 1969 American musical drama film directed by William A. Graham and starring Elvis Presley and Mary Tyler Moore. Written by James Lee, S.S. Schweitzer, and Eric Bercovici, based on a story by John Joseph
and Richard Morris, the film is about three Catholic nuns, preparing for their final vows, who are sent to a rough inner city neighborhood dressed as lay missionaries to work at a clinic run by a young doctor. Their lives become complicated by the realities they face in the inner city, and by the doctor who falls in love with one of the nuns.
The film was produced by Joe Connelly for NBC Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures. Filmed on location in the Los Angeles area and at the Universal Studios during March and April 1969, Change of Habit was released in the United States on November 10, 1969. It spent four weeks on the Variety Box Office Survey, peaking at #17.
Change of Habit was Presley's 31st and final film acting role; his remaining film appearances were in concert documentaries. The film was Moore's fourth and final film under her brief Universal Pictures contract; she would not appear in another theatrical movie until Ordinary People in 1980. Moore and Edward Asner, who also appears in the film, would go on to star in The Mary Tyler Moore Show, one of the most popular television shows in the 1970s.

The Canadian DVD release retains its original release title.
Produced by Brightlight Pictures and the first film underwritten in part by MuchMusic, Going the Distance was a brand extension for the music television channel and a foray into theatrical feature films by MuchMusic's then-corporate ownership CHUM Limited.
Recent changes to Telefilm Canada funding rewarded the producers of domestic films that were commercial successes in English Canada, and Going the Distance was a bid for such success.

Jean Piaget  (French: [ʒɑ̃ pjaˈʒɛ]; 9 August 1896 – 16 September 1980) was a Swiss clinical psychologist known for his pioneering work in child development. 
Piaget's theory of cognitive development and epistemological view are together called "genetic epistemology".
Piaget placed great importance on the education of children. As the Director of the International Bureau of Education, he declared in 1934 that "only education is capable of saving our societies from possible collapse, whether violent, or gradual."
Piaget's theory and research influenced several people. His theory of child development is studied in pre-service education programs. Educators continue to incorporate constructionist-based strategies.
Piaget created the International Center for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva in 1955 while on the faculty of the University of Geneva and directed the Center until his death in 1980. The number of collaborations that its founding made possible, and their impact, ultimately led to the Center being referred to in the scholarly literature as "Piaget's factory."
According to Ernst von Glasersfeld, Jean Piaget was "the great pioneer of the constructivist theory of knowing." However, his ideas did not become widely popularized until the 1960s. This then led to the emergence of the study of development as a major sub-discipline in psychology. By the end of the 20th century, Piaget was second only to B. F. Skinner as the most cited psychologist of that era.

A line slightly longer than the note head is drawn parallel to the staff, above or below, spaced at the same distance as the lines within the staff (see Figure 1).
The origin of the word is uncertain, but may have been borrowed attributively from the term used to describe a horizontal timber in a scaffolding, lying parallel to the face of the building and supporting the putlogs. There is no basis to support the often-found claim that the word originates from the French léger, meaning "light" or "slight"

In law, a commanding precedent is a precedent whose facts are "on all fours" with the case at hand. In other words, it almost exactly tracks it, sharing near-identical facts and issues. A commanding precedent is also referred to as a "Goose" case in Louisiana; "Spotted Horse" or "Spotted Dog" cases in Alabama; "Cow" case in Kansas; and "White Horse" or "White Pony" cases in Texas. A legal rule can be "clearly established" without commanding precedent existing. For example, in the United States, a governmental official is generally protected by qualified immunity if his acts were objectively legally reasonable, but such protection may not apply if, in light of pre-existing law, the unlawfulness of his conduct would have been apparent to a reasonably competent official, even if no commanding precedent applicable to his specific behavior existed.Such a precedent is called on all fours when all four parts of the instant (or present) case are essentially the same as the mandatory precedent, or are very similar:

 The parties are the same, or have such great similarities as to have exactly the same standing.
 The circumstances involving the two cases are materially the same, or are so similar as not to matter.
 The issue is exactly the same, or if more than one issue exists, they are materially the same types.
 The remedy the plaintiff or petitioner seeks is of the same kind as in the past case.
By comparison, a case on point is one in which a case has factual circumstances and issues similar to the case being researched, but which has different parties seeking somewhat different remedies.

Aggression insurance is a concept in anarcho-capitalism under which, rather than having a civil authority provide security of life, liberty, and property, individuals would buy insurance to cover damage caused by others' aggression. A legal right would exist for a victim to collect damages from an offender; upon filing a claim and collecting money from the insurer, the right to restitution would be subrogated to the insurer, who would then have an incentive to find the offending party and demand restitution.
Proponents of this system argue that a victim would have a stronger incentive to report crimes, and that an insurer would have a stronger incentive than a civil authority to collect from the offending party and repay the victim for damages while reducing collateral damage and maximizing loss prevention. Moreover, proponents claim that insurers would guide citizens in the direction of purchasing effective countermeasures against aggression, by offering lower insurance premiums for reduced risk of claims.
Opponents of aggression insurance argue that such a system may harm or remove the notion of impartial justice by providing insurers incentive to always seek restitution rather than analyze whether restitution is warranted. Opponents also express concern over the possibility of those without such insurance having basic rights go unprotected.

However, the term itself was coined by a colleague in college.Transnationalism as an economic process involves the global reorganization of the production process, in which various stages of the production of any product can occur in various countries, typically with the aim of minimizing costs.  Economic transnationalism, commonly known as Globalization, was spurred in the latter half of the 20th century by the development of the internet and wireless communication, as well as the reduction in global transportation costs caused by containerization.  Multinational corporations could be seen as a form of transnationalism, in that they seek to minimize costs, and hence maximize profits, by organizing their operations in the most efficient means possible irrespective of political boundaries.
Proponents of capitalists transnationalism seek to facilitate the flow of people, ideas, and goods among regions. They believe that it has increasing relevance with the rapid growth of capitalist globalization. They contend that it does not make sense to link specific nation-state boundaries with for instance migratory workforces, globalized corporations, global money flow, global information flow, and global scientific cooperation.
However, critical theories of transnationalism have argued that transnational capitalism has occurred through the increasing monopolization and centralization of capital by leading dominant groups in the global economy and various power blocs.  Scholars critical of global capitalism (and its global ecological and inequality crises) have argued instead for a transnationalism from below between workers and co-operatives as well as popular social and political movements. (Robinson, 2004)
Transnationalism as concept, theory and experience has nourished an important literature in social sciences. In practice transnationalism refers to increasing functional integration of processes that cross-borders or according to others trans bordered relations of individuals, groups, firms and to mobilizations beyond state boundaries. Individuals, groups, institutions and states interact with each other in a new global space where cultural and political characteristic of national societies are combined with emerging multilevel and multinational activities. Transnationalism is a part of the process of capitalist globalization. The concept of transnationalism refers to multiple links and interactions linking people and institutions across the borders of nation-states.

Some have argued that Diasporas, such as the overseas Chinese, are a historical precursor to modern transnationalism. However, unlike some people with transnationalist lives, most diasporas have not been voluntary. The field of diaspora politics does consider modern diasporas as having the potential to be transnational political actors and be influenced by transnational political forces. While the term transnationalism emphasizes the ways in which nations are no longer able to contain or control the disputes and negotiations through which social groups annex a global dimension to their meaningful practices, the notion of diaspora brings to the fore the racial dynamics underlying  the international division of labor and the economic turmoil of global capital. In an article published in 2006, Asale Angel-Ajani  claimed that “there is the possibility within diaspora studies to move away from the politically sanitized discourse that surrounds transnational studies.”(296) Since African diaspora studies have focused on racial formation, racism, and white supremacy, diaspora theory has the potential to bring to transnationalism “a varied political, if not radical political, perspective to the study of transnational processes and --globalization” (296).

The Third Symphony by Alfred Schnittke was his fourth composition in the symphonic form, completed in 1981.
Like its predecessor, it is in four movements: an opening Moderato, followed by an Allegro, a long movement marked Allegro pesante, with the briefer finale marked Adagio. At around 50 minutes, it is Schnittke's third longest symphony, after the First and Second symphonies.
It shares an intensity similar to the First Symphony, but unlike that work has a more traditional form, and contains no direct quotations. Nonetheless, the influence of many composers hangs over the piece (Richard Taruskin called the opening of the work "Wagner's Rheingold prelude, cubed and cubed again."), not merely stylistically but in Schnittke's repeated use of composers' initials. These include Bach, Handel, Mozart, Schoenberg, Stockhausen and Hans Werner Henze. Further use is made of transposed words later in the work: in the third movement the word "das Böse" ("the Evil") appears as an eight-note tone row (D, A, E flat, A flat, B flat, E, E flat, E), with the B-A-C-H monogram dominating the final movement.
The work was premiered in Leipzig on 5 November 1981, with Kurt Masur conducting the Leipzig Gewandhausorchester in Schnittke's presence. It was first recorded in 1984 by Gennadi Rozhdestvensky with the USSR Ministry of Culture Symphony Orchestra. A further recording appeared in the 1990s with the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra under Eri Klas.

In theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG) refers to a mathematical apparatus that allows systematic  investigation of the changes of a physical system as viewed at different distance scales. In particle physics, it reflects the changes in the underlying force laws (codified in a quantum field theory) as  the energy scale at which physical processes occur varies, energy/momentum  and resolution distance scales being effectively conjugate under the uncertainty principle (cf. Compton wavelength).
A change in scale is called a "scale transformation".  The renormalization group is intimately related to "scale invariance" and "conformal invariance", symmetries in which a system appears the same at all scales (so-called self-similarity). (Note that scale transformations are a strict subset of conformal transformations, in general, the latter including additional symmetry generators associated with special conformal transformations.)
As the scale varies, it is as if one is changing the magnifying power of a notional microscope viewing the system. In so-called renormalizable theories, the system at one scale will generally be seen to consist of self-similar copies of itself when viewed at a smaller scale, with different parameters describing the components of the system. The components, or fundamental variables, may  relate to atoms, elementary particles, atomic spins, etc.  The parameters of the theory typically describe the interactions of the components. These may be variable "couplings" which measure the strength of various forces, or mass parameters themselves. The components themselves may appear to be composed of more of the self-same components as one goes to shorter distances.
For example, in quantum electrodynamics (QED), an electron appears to be composed of electrons, positrons (anti-electrons) and photons, as one views it at higher resolution, at very short distances. The electron at such short distances has a slightly different electric charge than does the "dressed electron" seen at large distances, and this change, or "running," in the value of the electric charge is determined by the renormalization group equation.

"C'mon and Get My Love" is a song by British dance producer D Mob, from his album A Little Bit of This, a Little Bit of That. It featured British singer Cathy Dennis, credited as "introducing" her. Even though it was not Dennis' first solo single, it established her as a major chart presence during the late 1980s to early 1990s and was later included in her debut solo album, Move To This in 1990.
The song peaked at #15 on the UK Singles Chart, which was quite moderate, considering the major Top 10 success she would achieve on this chart in the future. In the United States, "C'mon and Get My Love" is the song most closely identified with D Mob, as the song crossed over to pop radio, and hit #10 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also topped the American dance chart, becoming the biggest hit of D Mob's career, and jump-starting Dennis' career as a solo artist.
The video was directed by Marek Budzynski.
The song appeared in the film She-Devil, which starred Meryl Streep and Roseanne Barr.

Comes Autumn Time is a concert overture by Leo Sowerby.  Originally composed for organ in October 1916, it was orchestrated the following year. The organ version was both commissioned and premiered by Eric DeLamarter at Fourth Presbyterian Church in Chicago on October 20, 1916. Because the piece was so well received, DeLamarter then asked the composer for an orchestral version, which he led in an all-Sowerby concert in Chicago in January 1917. With the score's publication in 1919 by the Boston Music Company, writes Francis Crociata of the Leo Sowerby Foundation, Comes Autumn Time was soon performed "in Boston by Pierre Monteux, Philadelphia by Stokowski, Minneapolis by Ganz, New York by Damrosch, London by Harty and Wood, Berlin by Rosbaud, and Vienna by Bruno Walter."
The piece is one of Sowerby's most popular, and was inspired by a poem by Bliss Carman entitled "Autumn".  (In tribute to Carman's contribution to the piece's origin, Sowerby directed that a copy of the poem be included with every printed copy of the score, a practice which is still carried on today.)  The piece became a personal favorite of Frederick Stock, then Music Director of what is now the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; upon Stock's death in 1942, the piece was played at his funeral at Stock's request.

The work opens with an exuberant and lively theme played on the bass clarinet, horns, and low strings.  A transition in the woodwinds bring on the second main subject, iterated by flutes and celesta against a harp and clarinet background.  The first subject is then developed, the second returning only in the recapitulation, followed by the first.  The piece finishes with a brilliant and lively coda, developed from the second theme.

BisRock is a subgenre of Pinoy rock, propagated by the Cebu rock music industry in the Philippines. The term, which is in the blended form, comes from the Cebuano words Bisaya, referring the Visayan language, and "rock", for rock music. The term was coined by Cebuano writer Januar E. Yap in 2002 and was first applied to Missing Filemon's first album.

Earning wide reception among the young in the Visayas and Mindanao, Bisrock is a fairly recent cultural phenomenon. The style started around the 1980s, when Cebu's rock scene was beginning to be labeled as "Bisrock". During this time, a group of musicians from the University of San Carlos coined the local music scene as Bisrock in support of patriotism for the Cebuano music scene. However, this genre is debatable as Bisrock seems to be popular only in Cebu. As it is, the movement died down around 2009, as even Missing Filemon themselves distanced itself from the term "Bisrock".

Especially active in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the al-Quds Brigades were founded in 1981 by Fathi Shaqaqi and Abd Al Aziz Awda in Gaza.The al-Quds Brigades were very active in the West Bank, especially in the town of Jenin, but extensive operations against its infrastructures carried out by the IDF resulted in severe losses to the group, and it appeared significantly weakened by 2004 in that region.On March 1, 2006 Abu al-Walid al-Dahdouh, a commander of the group's military wing, was targeted and killed by a bomb or missile as he drove past the Palestinian finance ministry. On August 30, 2006 the West Bank leader of the Islamic Jihad's  military wing, al-Quds Brigades, Hussam Jaradat, was shot and killed by undercover Israel Defense Forces in the city of Jenin.In the Gaza Strip, the al-Quds Brigades continued to fight militarily, e.g. by indiscriminate al-Quds rocket-attacks out of populated civilian areas. The al-Quds Brigades promote the military destruction of Israel, e.g. indiscriminate rocket and mortar fire or suicide bombings. The international community considers the use of indiscriminate attacks on civilian populations and the use of human shields as illegal under international law.
Their cause is the establishment of an Islamic state and to settle Palestinians to what the brigades consider their rightful homeland within the geographic borders of the pre-1948 British-mandated Palestine. It refuses to participate in political processes or negotiations about a swap of Israeli and Palestinian settlements.

In software engineering, a Library Oriented Architecture (LOA) is a set of principles and methodologies for designing and developing software in the form of reusable software libraries constrained in a specific ontology domain. LOA provides one of the many alternate methodologies that enable the further exposure of software through a service-oriented architecture. Library orientation dictates the ontological boundaries of a library that exposes business functionality through a set of public APIs. Library Oriented Architecture further promotes practices similar to Modular Programming, and encourages the maintenance of internal libraries and modules with independent internal open-source life-cycles. This approach promotes good software engineering principles and patterns such as separation of concerns and designing to interfaces as opposed to implementations.

A Bass chorus is an electronic effect used with the electric bass. It creates the same "shimmering" sound as a chorus effect for electric guitar chorus pedals. The difference is that bass chorus pedals are modified in various ways to suit the low pitch register of the electric bass. While several bass chorus pedal manufacturers have modified the chorus circuit so that it does not affect the lower register, others have designed the effect so that it can have an effect on even very low pitches.
The requirements for a chorus effect using a pedal or effect unit can vary depending on the type of instrument being used. Bass is a perfect example because it operates at a lower frequency range than a guitar. As such, a standard multi-level chorus can make the sound of the bass notes much thinner. This problem can be corrected by either mixing more of the un-affected signal into the mix or by increasing the amount of bass frequency chorused in the sound. Pedals such as the "I90" chorus from bass amplifier manufacturer Eden Electronics allow the musician to control both of these elements.

In the mathematical area of order theory, completeness properties assert the existence of certain infima or suprema of a given partially ordered set (poset). The most familiar example is the completeness of the real numbers. A special use of the term refers to complete partial orders or complete lattices. However, many other interesting notions of completeness exist.
The motivation for considering completeness properties derives from the great importance of suprema (least upper bounds, joins, "<math>\vee</math>") and infima (greatest lower bounds, meets, "<math>\wedge</math>") to the theory of partial orders. Finding a supremum means to single out one distinguished least element from the set of upper bounds. On the one hand, these special elements often embody certain concrete properties that are interesting for the given application (such as being the least common multiple of a set of numbers or the union of a collection of sets). On the other hand, the knowledge that certain types of subsets are guaranteed to have suprema or infima enables us to consider the computation of these elements as total operations on a partially ordered set. For this reason, posets with certain completeness properties can often be described as algebraic structures of a certain kind. In addition, studying the properties of the newly obtained operations yields further interesting subjects.

Splitter tour buses (also known as splitter vans or splitter buses) are specially converted vehicles commonly used by bands to travel on tour. Their principal defining feature is a bulkhead placed halfway down the vehicle, in front of which are situated seats for carrying passengers and behind which is an area for storing equipment. Splitter buses tend to be built on normal van chassis and the most common base vehicle used is the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter.
Splitter buses are very common in Europe where, along with sleeper coaches, they provide transportation for most professional touring acts. They are less common in North America, where the combination of minibus and trailer is favoured.
In Europe splitter buses tend to be configured to carry the driver plus eight passengers due to driving license laws within the European Union which restrict holders of a normal car license from driving vehicles over 3.5 tons in weight or with over eight passenger seats. Larger splitters do exist, however, with some vehicles configured to carry up 11 or 12 passengers.

More expensive splitters commonly come with entertainment packages in the passenger area that may include DVD players, games consoles, CD stereos and MP3 Player docks, mobile internet access. Splitter buses are not produced in the factory by vehicle manufacturers, but rather, they are built by specialist coach builders. Since 2011 it has been a legal requirement in the UK and the rest of the EU to have all new splitter van conversions (whether on second hand vehicles or brand new) tested for safety by the relevant vehicle standards agency through the IVA system. All components used in the build must meet strict EU safety requirements.

The Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments of 1932–1934 (sometimes World Disarmament Conference or Geneva Disarmament Conference) was an effort by member states of the League of Nations, together with the U.S., to actualize the ideology of disarmament.  It took place in the Swiss city of Geneva, ostensibly between 1930 and 1934, but more correctly until May 1937.
The first effort at international arms limitation was made at the Hague Conferences of 1899 and 1907, which had failed in their primary objective.  Although many contemporary commentators (and Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles) had blamed the outbreak of the First World War on the war guilt of Germany, historians writing in the 1930s began to emphasize the fast-paced arms race preceding 1914.  Further, all the major powers except the US had committed themselves to disarmament in both the Treaty of Versailles and the Covenant of the League of Nations. A substantial international non-governmental campaign to promote disarmament also developed in the 1920s and early 1930s.
A preparatory commission was initiated by the League in 1925; by 1931, there was sufficient support to hold a conference, which duly began under the chairmanship of former British Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson.  The motivation behind the talks can be summed up by an extract from the message President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent to the conference: "If all nations will agree wholly to eliminate from possession and use the weapons which make possible a successful attack, defences automatically will become impregnable and the frontiers and independence of every nation will become secure."The talks were beset by a number of difficulties from the outset.  Among these were disagreements over what constituted "offensive" and "defensive" weapons, and the polarization of France and Germany.  The increasingly military-minded German governments could see no reason why their country could not enjoy the same level of armaments as other powers, especially France.  The French, for their part, were equally insistent that German military inferiority was their only insurance from future conflict as serious as they had endured in the First World War. As for the British and US governments, they were unprepared to offer the additional security commitments that France requested in exchange for limitation of French armaments.

The talks broke down and Hitler withdrew Germany from both the Conference and the League of Nations in October 1933.  The 1930s had proved far too self-interested an international period to accommodate multilateral action in favour of pacifism.

Zygmunt Wilhelm Birnbaum (18 October 1903 – 15 December 2000) was a Polish-American mathematician and statistician who contributed to functional analysis, nonparametric testing and estimation, probability inequalities, survival distributions, competing risks, and reliability theory.
After first earning a law degree and briefly practicing law, Birnbaum obtained his PhD in 1929 at the University of Lwów under the supervision of Hugo Steinhaus, and was associated with the Lwów School of Mathematics.  He visited Göttingen, Germany from 1929 to 1931.
After studying insurance mathematics and earning a  Versicherungsmathematik Diplom  with Felix Bernstein in Göttingen, he worked as an actuary in Vienna during 1931–1932, and was then transferred to Lwów where he continued working as an actuary.  After obtaining a position as a correspondent
for a Polish newspaper, he arrived in New York as a reporter in 1937.   He became a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Washington in 1939 (with help from Harold Hotelling and letters of reference from Richard Courant, Albert Einstein, and Edmund Landau).
Birnbaum was actively involved in reliability work with Boeing through the Boeing Scientific Research Laboratories during the late 1950s and 1960s, and was a key member of the "Seattle school of reliability", a group which also included Tom Bray, Gordon Crawford, James Esary, George Marsaglia, Al Marshall, Frank Proschan, Ron Pyke, and Sam Saunders.
Birnbaum served as Editor of the Annals of Mathematical Statistics (1967–1970) and as President of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (1964).  He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1960 (spent at the Sorbonne, Paris), and a Fulbright Program Fellowship in 1964 (spent at the University of Rome).

Charles Alexander Weibel (born October 28, 1950 in Terre Haute, Indiana) is an American mathematician working on algebraic K-theory, algebraic geometry and homological algebra.
Weibel studied physics and mathematics at the University of Michigan, earning bachelor's degrees in both subjects in 1972. He was awarded a master's degree by the University of Chicago in 1973 and achieved his doctorate in 1977 under the supervision of Richard Swan (Homotopy in Algebraic K-Theory). From 1970 to 1976 he was an "Operations Research Analyst" at Standard Oil in Indiana, and spent 1977–78 at the Institute for Advanced Study. In 1978 he became an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania and in 1980 an assistant professor at Rutgers University, where he was promoted to professor in 1989.
He joined Vladimir Voevodsky and Markus Rost in proving the (motivic) Bloch–Kato conjecture (2009). It is a generalization of the Milnor conjecture of algebraic K-theory, which was proved by Voevodsky in the 1990s.
He was a visiting professor in 1992 in Paris and 1993 in Strasbourg. Since 1983 he has been an editor of the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra.

In 2014, he became a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

Natura contro (English: Against Nature), also known in English as The Green Inferno and Cannibal Holocaust II, is a 1988 Italian cannibal film directed by mondo director Antonio Climati. Climati had no intention of making a sequel to Cannibal Holocaust, and the title was used by distributors of the film to cash in on the success and notoriety of the earlier film.
Until recently, the film was relatively obscure. It is best known among cult fans as the film that ended the cannibal genre, which, by then, had virtually fallen extinct. In 2002, British distributor VIPCO released Natura Contro on VHS and DVD as Cannibal Holocaust II, the film's most common release.
This was the last film directed by Climati, who had gained notoriety as a major player in the mondo documentary film genre. Although fictional, this film deals with many common tropes of mondo films, including exotic customs and locales, and cruel violence. Strangely, however, the film appears to show compassion towards animals, while a main staple of mondo films is often real violence towards animals.

Convention over configuration (also known as coding by convention) is a software design paradigm used by software frameworks that attempt to decrease the number of decisions that a developer using the framework is required to make without necessarily losing flexibility.  The concept was introduced by David Heinemeier Hansson to describe the philosophy of the Ruby on Rails web framework, but is related to earlier ideas like the concept of "sensible defaults" and the principle of least astonishment in user interface design.
The phrase essentially means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application. For example, if there is a class Sales in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called "sales" by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as calling the table "product sales", that one needs to write code regarding these names.
When the convention implemented by the tool matches the desired behavior, it behaves as expected without having to write configuration files. Only when the desired behavior deviates from the implemented convention is explicit configuration required.
Ruby on Rails' use of the phrase is particularly focused on its default project file and directory structure, which prevent developers from having to write XML configuration files to specify which modules the framework should load, which was common in many earlier frameworks.
Disadvantages of the convention over configuration approach can occur due to conflicts with other software design principles, like the Zen of Python's "explicit is better than implicit."  A software framework based on convention over configuration often involves a domain-specific language with a limited set of constructs or an inversion of control in which the developer can only affect behavior using a limited set of hooks, both of which can make implementing behaviors not easily expressed by the provided conventions more difficult than when using a software library that does not try to decrease the number of decisions developers have to make or require inversion of control.
Other methods of decreasing the number of decisions a developer needs to make include programming idioms and configuration libraries with a multilayered architecture.

Vicente Lusitano (died after 1561) was a Portuguese music composer and theorist of the late Renaissance.
He was born in Olivença, but little else is known for certain of his life, including the dates of his birth and death. Some information is recorded in the 18th century biography by Barbosa Machado:  he came from Olivença, became a priest, and was employed as a teacher both at Padua and Viterbo. Very little of what Machado wrote about him has been verified by any other source, except the date of publication (1561) of a music theory treatise at Venice.
As a composer he wrote a number of choral works, including motets and a madrigal, but he is better known by far for his work as a theorist. In a 1551 debate in Rome, he espoused traditional views on the role of the three genera in music (diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic) over more radical ones put forward by Nicola Vicentino (Lusitano was deemed to have won the debate). His Introdutione facilissima et novissima de canto fermo (Rome, 1553, and again at Venice, 1561), contains an introduction to music, a section on improvised counterpoint, and his views on the three genera.

Originally released by the French label Shandar with the catalog number Shandar 83.510 and never re-released on CD, Dream House 78' 17"  is one of the very few recordings ever made by minimalist composer La Monte Young, in this case together with his long-time companion Marian Zazeela and his group the Theatre of Eternal Music. The 78' 17" in the title consists of the duration of the record measured in minutes and seconds. This length, almost double what was then normal, was extremely unusual in its time. Young in the sleeve notes says that "Time is so important to the experiencing and understanding of the music in the record that every effort was made to make the record last as much as the original master tapes". Young thanks Mr. Michel Blancvillain who made it technically possible.
Cover, labels, design and calligraphy are by Marian Zazeela, and are drawn in her trademark magenta on a black background.

The two inner sides of the record jacket contain a comment by Shandar founder Daniel Caux, plus extensive original notes penned by La Monte Young himself about the music, its structure and its history. In 2016 Aguirre Records reissued the album on vinyl in a limited-edition, remasted form.

Rideau Hall is a Canadian television series broadcast begun in 2002 on CBC Television.  It starred Bette MacDonald, Fiona Reid, Jonathan Torrens, Joe Dinicol, and Rejean Cournoyer.
It is a sitcom about an earthy, one-hit wonder disco queen named Regina Gallant (MacDonald) who is recommended for appointment as Governor General by a conniving Prime Minister anticipating she will become a national embarrassment in the job, allowing him to move ahead in eliminating the position, along with the Canadian monarchy. Regina is brash and loud and highly unsuitable for a formal position, but has a charming common touch.
Each episode has her becoming embroiled in one scandal or another, usually not of her making, only to have things resolve in her favour by the end.  Reid plays her prim and proper executive assistant, Torrens her flakey gay secretary, and Dinicol her laconic, level-headed son. Cournoyer plays the Prime Minister's aide.
Barry Flatman played the P.M. in the pilot, but did not appear in the regular series.
The series brought in fairly good ratings for the CBC and it was expected the show would be renewed for a second season; however, the show was cancelled after the Canadian Television Fund's budget was cut by the federal government and CBC could only afford to keep its more popular shows, like Royal Canadian Air Farce, on the air. Six half-hour episodes plus an hour-long pilot were produced.

Elmer Clifton (March 14, 1890 – October 15, 1949) was an American writer, director, and actor from the early silent days. A collaborator of D.W. Griffith, he appeared in The Birth of a Nation (1915) and Intolerance (1916) before giving up acting in 1917 to concentrate on work behind the camera, with Griffith and Joseph Henabery as his mentors. His first feature-length solo effort as a director was The Flame of Youth with Jack Mulhall.
Clifton honed his talents during the late 1910s, directing vehicles for Mulhall and Herbert Rawlinson at Universal and then for Dorothy Gish for Famous Players-Lasky. Two of his projects with Gish, Nobody Home and Nugget Nell, featured performances from pre-stardom Rudolph Valentino. Most of this early output has been lost. He was the first filmmaker to discover the talents of Clara Bow, whom he cast in Down to the Sea in Ships, released on March 4, 1923. The independently produced film was well reviewed for its visual authenticity.
During the 1920s, Clifton directed films for several different studios. During the filming of The Warrens of Virginia (1924) for Fox Film Corporation, lead actress Martha Mansfield suffered a fatal accident from burns when her costume caught fire. Clifton directed The Wreck of the Hesperus for Cecil B. deMille's production company, and filmed on location in the Grand Canyon for The Bride of the Colorado. He also directed some Technicolor short films, including Manchu Love with an all-Asian cast.
In the sound era, Clifton wrote and directed many poverty row Westerns and "exploitation" classics, among them the anti-marijuana polemic Assassin of Youth (1937). He also directed the vice films Gambling with Souls (1936), Slaves in Bondage (1937) and City of Missing Girls (1941), all of which portrayed addiction and white slavery to some degree. His last film was Not Wanted (1949), which was finished by star Ida Lupino when Clifton became ill and was unable to work anymore. He died in 1949 of a cerebral hemorrhage shortly after the film's release.

In economics and finance, a Taleb distribution is a returns profile that appears at times deceptively low-risk with steady returns, but experiences periodically catastrophic drawdowns. The term was coined by journalist Martin Wolf and economist John Kay, and is named after Nassim Taleb, based on ideas outlined in his Fooled by Randomness. According to Taleb in Silent Risk, it should be called "payoff" not a "distribution". It does not describe a statistical probability distribution, and does not have an associated mathematical formula.  The term is meant to refer to an investment returns profile in which there is a high probability of a small gain, and a small probability of a very large loss, which more than outweighs the gains. In these situations the expected value is very much less than zero, but this fact is camouflaged by the appearance of low risk and steady returns. It is a combination of kurtosis risk and skewness risk: overall returns are dominated by extreme events (kurtosis), which are to the downside (skew).

More detailed and formal discussion of the bets on small probability events is in the academic essay by Taleb, called "Why Did the Crisis of 2008 Happen?" and in the 2004 paper in the Journal of Behavioral Finance called "Why Do We Prefer Asymmetric Payoffs?" in which he writes "agents risking other people’s capital would have the incentive to camouflage the properties by showing a steady income. Intuitively, hedge funds are paid on an annual basis while disasters happen every four or five years, for example. The fund manager does not repay his incentive fee."

A line doubler is a device used to deinterlace video signals prior to display.  
The main function of a line doubler is to take an interlaced video source which consists of a two-field frame and create a progressive scan (single non-interlaced frame) output.  This can produce a smoother, higher-resolution picture.  The additional lines provide greater light output and makes for an image that is smoother and more film like. CRT-based displays (both direct-view and projection) are capable of directly displaying both interlaced and progressive video, and therefore the line-doubling process is an optional step to enhance picture quality. Most other types of display, including LCD, plasma and DLP, generally cannot accept an interlaced signal directly, and therefore some kind of line doubler must be used. This is usually built in and transparent to the user. Progressive scan DVD players also feature a line doubler.
The most basic and literal way to double lines is to repeat each scanline, though the results of this are generally very crude. Most line doublers use digital interpolation to recreate the missing lines in an interlaced signal, and the resulting quality depends on the technique used. Generally a line doubler will only interpolate within a single field, rather than merging information from adjacent fields, to preserve the smoothness of motion, resulting in a frame rate equal to the field rate (i.e. a 60i signal would be converted to 60p.) Some line doublers are capable of using the former technique in moving areas and the latter in static areas (to avoid bob effect), which improves overall sharpness. It is worth noting that even if a line doubler employs the merging method it cannot be considered an inverse telecine device if a frame rate of 60p other than the original 24p is obtained. From this aspect of view some hyped progressive scan technologies (including Pioneer's PureCinema Progressive Scan) bearing an inverse telecine insignia are thus overstated. 
Line doublers have been replaced recently by video scalers which incorporate 3:2 pulldown removal and the ability to scale the image to the various screen resolutions used on LCD, plasma display and DLP projectors and displays.

Evita is a documentary film on the life of Eva Duarte created by Eduardo Montes-Bradley. Conformed in its entirety with previously unseen historical footage and documents, the film reconstructs the life of the former Argentine first lady from an unbiased perspective. The film starts with meticulous examination of Evita Duarte's origins, her relationship with her parents (particularly her father) and her siblings. Evita goes on to reveal intimate aspects of Duarte's early childhood and adolescence, leading to her resolving to flee her home in the countryside for the capital city of Buenos Aires. The latter segments of the film are highlighted by interviews with former teachers from her elementary schooling in Junin, a small city in the province of Buenos Aires. Throughout the film, the director is steadily reminding the audience of the domestic and international context out of which Evita Duarte emerged, enhancing the viewer's understanding the facts. The second act of the film concludes with her funeral in Buenos Aires. The third act exposes the macabre plot to have Evita Peron's corpse disappear, and looks at the curious series of events leading to the exchange of cadavers between the so-called Peronist youth and the military regime. Evita premiered in the US on WCVE Richmond-PBS, and WHTJ Charlottesville-PBS on July 12, 2012. Evita has been included in courses on Political Science and History. Most recently, the documentary was listed 11 in the “Top 25 Political Documentaries That Shed Light On Latin America’s Reality"

The Battle for Whiteclay is a documentary film released in 2008 which chronicles the efforts of Native American activists Frank LaMere (Winnebago), Duane Martin Sr., and Russell Means to end the sale of alcohol in Whiteclay, Nebraska.  Directed and produced by Mark Vasina, the film covers the economy of the approximately one dozen residents and four liquor stores, which sell nearly 5 million cans of beer annually (12,500 cans a day).  The largest populated place nearby is the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation across the border in South Dakota; its residents are largely members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe.
Except for a brief interval, the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST) has banned the sale and consumption of alcohol on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation since 1832. A high proportion of residents buy it in Whiteclay and consume it illegally.  They suffer from high rates of alcoholism, diabetes and related health and social problems.
Vasina is a documentary filmmaker living in Lincoln, Nebraska, and the former president of the non-profit group Nebraskans For Peace.

The Bilingual Education Act (BEA),  Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1968, was the first piece of United States federal legislation that recognized the needs of Limited English Speaking Ability (LESA) students. The BEA was introduced in 1967 by Texas senator Ralph Yarborough and was signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson on January 2, 1968. As such, it was the first federal legislation signed into law in the 1968 calendar year. The bill was passed as Title VII, an amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). While many states such as California and Texas already had local and state policies to help language minority students, the BEA established the first federal policy aiding students of LESA.  Passed on the heels of the Civil Rights movement, its purpose was to provide school districts with federal funds, in the form of competitive grants, to establish innovative educational programs for students with limited English speaking ability. While the BEA addressed all linguistic minorities in the country, the passage of the act was spearheaded by Spanish speakers.

Wilhelm Friedrich Mittrich (born 1950 in Kiel, Germany) is a German entrepreneur who became notable for being the CEO of ODS, a company that was Europes largest CD & DVD Replicator until its failure in October 2007.
Around the year 2000, Mittrich was a member of the management team of Mick Fleetwood backed British online music distributor Point Group Ltd, which went bankrupt with a debt of £ 10 million when a planned public offering collapsed in the dot-com bubble of 2000. In 2004, the British government subsequently banned him from leading or founding a business in the United Kingdom for a period of four years.
According to Der Spiegel, ODS paid €6.8 million for exclusive licenses to Hollywood's film studios. Another €10.4 million were spent for a lawsuit on licenses. In this lawsuit ODS defended its position against a license pool that granted what ODS deemed unfair commercial advantage to certain competitors of ODS in respect to license dues. Internally held shares in the company were allegedly sold so as to further produce assets, an operation deemed worth €23 million but no wrongdoing has ever been proven. In October 2007 the company filed for insolvency and on 29 February 2008 the Dassow plant finally stopped its production. The former management under Wilhelm Friedrich Mittrich is since being investigated by authorities for tax and subsidiary fraud and for professional patent violations but to date no proof has been forthcoming. In August 2010 the public prosecutor's office at Schwerin charged the three former managers of ODS with fraud in the order of millions. This has been one of many so far unsuccessful attempts to build such a case.

Sir John Shelley, 5th Baronet (1730 – 11 September 1783), of Michelgrove in Sussex, was an English Member of Parliament.
He was the eldest son of Sir John Shelley, 4th Baronet and Margaret Pelham, two of whose brothers (Henry Pelham and The Duke of Newcastle) served as British Prime Minister. He entered Parliament at a by-election in 1751, probably at the first opportunity once he was legally old enough to do so, as member for East Retford, a pocket borough owned by his uncle Newcastle; the vacancy arose from the appointment of the sitting MP as a Commissioner of the Excise, quite possibly with the specific intention of freeing the seat for Shelley. He represented this constituency until 1768 when, having fallen out with Newcastle, he moved to represent nearby Newark (which had once also been under Newcastle's control but now belonged to another of Newcastle's nephews, the Earl of Lincoln, who had also quarrelled with his uncle). He was later also MP for New Shoreham.
In 1755, on the recommendation of Newcastle (who had become Prime Minister on his brother's death the previous year), Shelley was appointed to the desirable sinecure-for-life of Keeper of the Records of the Tower of London, worth £420 a year. In 1757 he acquired another lucrative post, Clerk of the Pipe, and in 1766 he became Treasurer of His Majesty's Household and was appointed to the Privy Council.
Shelley succeeded to the baronetcy on his father's death on 5 September 1771. He married Wilhelmina Newnham (died 1772), daughter of John Newnham of Maresfield Park, by whom he had a son, John, who succeeded him. After the death of his first wife he married again, to Elizabeth Woodcock, and they had three daughters.
He retired from Parliament in 1780, and died in 1783.

Sampling Slave's "Just a Touch of Love", "Alright" was officially released on July 13, 1993 as the lead single from Da Bomb and became the album's biggest hit, peaking at #19 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the duo's third single to reach #1 on the Hot Rap Singles ("Jump" and "Warm It Up" being the first two). "Alright" also contains a diss to rival group, Da Youngstas, who had been critical of Kris Kross due to their success on the Billboard charts and the fact that they did not write their lyrics. Chris Kelly AKA "Mac Daddy" responded with the lyric "I didn't come out wack I came out right, unlike them moles who choose to pass da mic", an obvious reference to Da Youngstas single "Pass da Mic".

"Alright" was certified gold by the RIAA on September 14, 1993 for sales of 500,000 copies.

Nine United States presidents have made presidential visits to Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. The first trip by an incumbent president to Eastern Europe was made by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, to the former Soviet Union, and was an offshoot of Allied diplomatic interactions during World War II. The first trip by an incumbent president to Northern Asia was made by Gerald Ford in 1974, also to the Soviet Union, and was an offshoot of U.S.–Soviet Détente during the Cold War. The first presidential visits to other Eastern European countries occurred during this era of easing geo-political tensions as well.
To date, 15 visits have been made to Russia (which is partially in Eastern Europe as well as the only country in Northern Asia), 13 to Poland, five to the Czech Republic, five to Romania, four to Hungary, four to Ukraine, two to Bulgaria, one to Belarus, and one to Slovakia. Additionally, six visits were made to the Soviet Union prior to its collapse. One visit was also made to Czechoslovakia prior to its dissolution. Moldova is the only Eastern European country which has not been visited by a sitting American president.

Singles are a type of music release that typically have fewer tracks than an extended play or album; during the 1950s, sales of singles in the United Kingdom were compiled by the magazine New Musical Express (NME), and published weekly as a record chart. The singles chart was founded in 1952 by Percy Dickins of NME, who wanted to imitate the hit parade that featured in the American magazine Billboard; before this, the popularity of a song had been measured by its sales of sheet music. Dickins sampled twenty shops, asking which their ten biggest-selling singles were. His aggregated list of sales was then published in NME on 14 November 1952 as a Top 12 chart. NME's chart is considered by the Official Charts Company (OCC) to be the canonical UK Singles Chart during the 1950s; it was expanded to a Top 20 on 1 October 1954.
Sales of records significantly increased in the mid-fifties, following the birth of rock and roll. As a result, the top ten biggest-selling singles of the 1950s were all released in the latter half of the decade. The biggest-selling single of this period was "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley & His Comets, which became the first single ever to sell more than a million copies in the UK.

This Is England is a 2006 British drama film written and directed by Shane Meadows. The story centres on young skinheads in England in 1983. The film illustrates how their subculture, which has its roots in 1960s West Indies culture, especially ska, soul, and reggae music, became adopted by white nationalists, which led to divisions within the skinhead scene. The film's title is a direct reference to a scene where the character Combo explains his nationalist views using the phrase "this is England" during his speech.

A hexalogy (from Greek ἑξα- hexa-, "six" and -λογία -logia, "discourse") is a compound literary or narrative work that is made up of six distinct works. The word apparently first appeared in English as a borrowing from German, in discussions of August Bungert's Wagnerian opera cycle entitled Homerische Welt based on the Iliad and the Odyssey. (He planned two tetralogies, but the third and fourth operas of the eight were never written.) Both pentalogie and hexalogie were used by Théophile Gautier in 1859. In 1923 the word was applied by an American reviewer to Johannes V. Jensen's The Long Journey.

IBM's first magnetic tape data storage devices, introduced in 1952, use what is now generally known as 7 track tape.  The magnetic tape is 1/2" wide and there are six data tracks plus one parity track for a total of seven parallel tracks that span the length of the tape.  Data is stored as six-bit characters, with each bit of the character and the additional parity bit stored in a different track.
These tape drives were mechanically sophisticated floor-standing drives that used vacuum columns to buffer long U-shaped loops of tape. Between active control of powerful reel motors and vacuum control of these U-shaped tape loops, extremely rapid start and stop of the tape at the tape-to-head interface could be achieved.  When active, the two tape reels thus fed tape into or pulled tape out of the vacuum columns, intermittently spinning in rapid, unsynchronized bursts resulting in visually striking action. Stock shots of such vacuum-column tape drives in motion were widely used to represent "the computer" in movies and television.

In computational complexity theory, an interactive proof system is an abstract machine that models computation as the exchange of messages between two parties. The parties, the verifier and the prover, interact by exchanging messages in order to ascertain whether a given string belongs to a language or not. The prover is all-powerful and possesses unlimited computational resources, but cannot be trusted, while the verifier has bounded computation power. Messages are sent between the verifier and prover until the verifier has an answer to the problem and has "convinced" itself that it is correct.
All interactive proof systems have two requirements:

 Completeness: if the statement is true, the honest verifier (that is, one following the protocol properly) can be convinced of this fact by an untrusted prover.
 Soundness: if the statement is false, no prover, even if it doesn't follow the protocol, can convince the honest verifier that it is true, except with some small probability.It is assumed that the verifier is always honest.
The specific nature of the system, and so the complexity class of languages it can recognize, depends on what sort of bounds are put on the verifier, as well as what abilities it is given — for example, most interactive proof systems depend critically on the verifier's ability to make random choices. It also depends on the nature of the messages exchanged — how many and what they can contain. Interactive proof systems have been found to have some important implications for traditional complexity classes defined using only one machine. The main complexity classes describing interactive proof systems are AM and  IP.

An igil (Tuvan- игил) is a two-stringed Tuvan musical instrument, played by bowing the strings. (It is called "ikili" in Western Mongolia.) The neck and lute-shaped sound box are usually made of a solid piece of pine or larch. The top of the sound box may be covered with skin or a thin wooden plate. The strings, and those of the bow, are traditionally made of hair from a horse's tail (strung parallel), but may also be made of nylon. Like the morin khuur of Mongolia, the igil typically features a carved horse's head at the top of the neck above the tuning pegs, and both instruments are known as the horsehead fiddle.
The igil is held nearly upright when played, with the sound box of the instrument in the performer's lap, or braced against the top of the performer's boot.  Playing technique involves touching the strings with the nails or fingertips, but without pressing them to the neck. The igil has no frets.  The bow is held with an underhand grip.
The igil formerly had an entire genre dedicated to it, with a repertoire of songs meant to be performed only on the igil. During the communist period in Tuva attempts were made to "modernize" the igil. This was nothing more than an attempt to westernize the instrument making it more like the European cello. However the instruments and playing style used by most Tuvan musicians today are largely the same as the original form of the igil.  
Famous players of the igil include Ak-ool Kara-sal, Kaigal-ool Khovalyg and Evgenii Saryglar.

The Pyrates Royale were a novelty musical group.  They specialized in playing nautical songs while costumed as pirates, each member of the group taking on an individual pirate persona for the performances.  The group and its members became local celebrities in the Maryland, Delaware, and Washington, D.C. area.  Many of their songs were traditional sea shanties, but there were a few original compositions included in their repertoire and some traditional songs with fresh lyrics.  They generally played in small venues, such as pubs and taverns, although they did occasionally perform at the Kennedy Center and on special shipboard events.  They were also regular performers on the Rennaissance Faire circuit.The Pyrates performed for thirty years before finally disbanding in 2016.  Members came and went, but the core of the group consisted of Brad Howard (as Captain Fletcher Moone), Craig Williams (as First Mate Long John Skivee), and Darcy Nair (as Navigator Kat Fairbanks)

Among their traditional seafaring songs were Fireship, What Do You Do With a Drunken Sailor?, and Bell-Bottomed Trousers.

The Movable cellular automaton (MCA) method is a method in computational solid mechanics based on the discrete concept. It provides advantages both of classical cellular automaton and discrete element methods. Important advantage of the МСА method is a possibility of direct simulation of materials fracture including damage generation, crack propagation, fragmentation and mass mixing. It is difficult to simulate these processes by means of continuum mechanics methods (For example: finite element method, finite difference method, etc.), so some new concepts like peridynamics are required. Discrete element method is very effective to simulate granular materials, but mutual forces among movable cellular automata provides simulating solids behavior. If size of automaton will be close to zero then MCA behavior becomes like classical continuum mechanics methods.

The Treaty on the Creation of the USSR officially created the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), commonly known as the Soviet Union. It de jure legalized a union of several Soviet republics and created a new centralized federal government (Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union and Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union (TSiK) were the legislative while Council of People's Commissars was the executive) where key functions were centralized in Moscow.
The Treaty along with the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR was approved on December 29, 1922 by a conference of delegations from the Russian SFSR, the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR. The Treaty and the Declaration were confirmed by the 1st Congress of Soviets of the USSR and signed by heads of delegations  –  Mikhail Kalinin, Mikhail Tskhakaya, Mikhail Frunze and Grigory Petrovsky, Aleksandr Chervyakov respectively on December 30, 1922. The treaty provided flexibility to admit new members. Therefore, by 1940 the Soviet Union grew from the founding four republics to 16 republics.
On December 8, 1991, Russian, Ukrainian and Belarus Presidents signed the Belavezha Accords. The agreement declared dissolution of the USSR by its founder states (denunciation of 1922 Treaty on the Creation of the USSR) and established the CIS. On December 10, the accords was ratified by the Ukrainian and Belarusian parliaments. On December 12, the agreement was ratified by the Russian Parliament, therefore Russian SFSR denounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and de facto declared Russia's independence from the USSR.

On December 26, 1991, the USSR was self-dissolved by the Council of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, a house of Soviet parliament (the second house, the Soviet of the Union was without a quorum).

The San Francisco graft trials were a series of attempts from 1905 to 1908 to prosecute members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, San Francisco Mayor Eugene Schmitz, attorney Abe Ruef, who were receiving bribes, and business owners who were paying the bribes. Political boss and attorney Ruef was at the center of the corruption, acting as attorney to Mayor Eugene Schmitz. He approved all contracts and received hundreds of thousands of dollars in payment from business owners, keeping a portion for himself and distributing the remainder to the Mayor and members of the Board of Supervisors.
Former mayor James Phelan along with banker Rudolph Spreckels and editor Fremont Older of the San Francisco Bulletin asked United States District Attorney Francis Heney, fresh from a successful stint as special assistant to the U.S. Attorney General's office in prosecuting the Oregon land fraud scandal, to help put an end to the corruption. Heney charged Ruef and Schmitz with numerous counts of bribery and brought them to trial. Heney rejected a juror because he was an ex-con and publicly accused Ruef of trying to plant him on the jury. During the trial, the rejected juror shot Heney in the face, but Heney survived. The juror was found dead in jail the next morning, and many suspected Ruef and his allies of complicity in his death. Some members of the public thought that Sheriff William Biggy was negligent, and when he fell off a boat late one night and drowned, some thought it may have been suicide, but others thought he may have been murdered.
Ruef's trial was eventually brought to a successful close by Assistant District Attorney Hiram Johnson and after several appeals Ruef served four years in San Quentin Prison. While there he wrote a series of tell-all columns for Older's Bulletin newspaper implicating a number of companies, executives, and public officials. Mayor Schmitz was found guilty, jailed, and then released and retried, but did not serve any time. All of the business owners and supervisors implicated received immunity for their testimony about Ruef's and Schmitz's complicity and were not arrested or charged. When new District Attorney Fisker, a former athlete, was elected, he stopped the investigations and all further prosecutions.

A quintet is a group containing five members.
It is commonly associated with musical groups, such as a string quintet, or a group of five singers, but can be applied to any situation where five similar or related objects are considered a single unit.
In classical instrumental music, any additional instrument (such as a piano, clarinet, oboe, etc.) joined to the usual string quartet (two violins, a viola, and a cello), gives the resulting ensemble its name, such as "piano quintet", "clarinet quintet", etc. A piece of music written for such a group is similarly named.
The standard wind quintet consists of one player each on flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, and horn, while the standard brass quintet has two trumpets, horn, trombone, and tuba. Other combinations, however, are sometimes found.
In jazz music, a quintet is group of five players, usually consisting of two of any of the following instruments, guitar, trumpet, saxophone, clarinet, flute or trombone in addition to traditional jazz trio – piano, double bass, drums.
In some modern bands there are quintets formed from the same family of instruments with various voices, as an all-brass ensemble, or all saxophones, in soprano, alto, baritone, and bass, and sometimes double bass.
Many rock, pop, and metal bands are made up of five people, normally consisting of two guitarists, a bassist, a drummer, and a lead vocalist. This is normally considered to the maximum size of most bands. However, several bands like Linkin Park, Slipknot, Guns N' Roses, and DragonForce have more than 5 band members. Having more than five members is mostly uncommon in rock and pop music.
It is becoming increasingly common in a cappella and barbershop music circles to use the fifth voice as vocal percussionist, with the remainder being a traditional SATB (soprano alto tenor bass) quartet, or perhaps SSAA or TTBB.

The scandal unfolded while Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in office, though the time period involved also covered successive governments during which Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats were all in power. Among those implicated in the scandal are the Taoiseach (prime minister) Enda Kenny, justice minister Alan Shatter (since resigned), Secretary General of the Department of Justice Brian Purcell, Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach Martin Fraser, attorney general Máire Whelan, Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan (since resigned), as well as Independent News & Media, Ireland's largest and most powerful media organisation.

An internal sort is any data sorting process that takes place entirely within the main memory of a computer. This is possible whenever the data to be sorted is small enough to all be held in the main memory. For sorting larger datasets, it may be necessary to hold only a chunk of data in memory at a time, since it won’t all fit. The rest of the data is normally held on some larger, but slower medium, like a hard-disk. Any reading or writing of data to and from this slower media can slow the sortation process considerably. This issue has implications for different sort algorithms.
Some common internal sorting algorithms include:

 Bubble Sort
 Insertion Sort
 Quick Sort
 Heap Sort
 Radix Sort
 Selection sortConsider a Bubblesort, where adjacent records are swapped in order to get them into the right order, so that records appear to “bubble” up and down through the dataspace. If this has to be done in chunks, then when we have sorted all the records in chunk 1, we move on to chunk 2, but we find that some of the records in chunk 1 need to “bubble through” chunk 2, and vice versa (i.e., there are records in chunk 2 that belong in chunk 1, and records in chunk 1 that belong in chunk 2 or later chunks). This will cause the chunks to be read and written back to disk many times as records cross over the boundaries between them, resulting in a considerable degradation of performance. If the data can all be held in memory as one large chunk, then this performance hit is avoided.
On the other hand, some algorithms handle external sorting rather better. A Merge sort breaks the data up into chunks, sorts the chunks by some other algorithm (maybe bubblesort or Quick sort) and then recombines the chunks two by two so that each recombined chunk is in order. This approach minimises the number or reads and writes of data-chunks from disk, and is a popular external sort method.

Robert David Kaplan (born June 23, 1952 in New York City) is an American author of many books on politics primarily foreign affairs and travel, whose work over three decades has appeared in The Atlantic, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The New Republic, The National Interest, Foreign Affairs and The Wall Street Journal, among other newspapers and publications.
His more controversial essays about the nature of US power have spurred debate and criticism in academia, the media, and the highest levels of government. One of Kaplan's most influential articles include "The Coming Anarchy", published in The Atlantic Monthly in 1994. Critics of the article has compared it to Huntingon's Clash of Civilizations thesis, since Kaplan presents conflicts in the contemporary world as the struggle between primitivism and civilizations. Another frequent theme in Kaplan's work is the reemergence of cultural and historical tensions temporarily suspended during the Cold War.

From March 2008 to spring 2012, Kaplan was a Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, which he rejoined in 2015. Between 2012 and 2014, he was chief geopolitical analyst at Stratfor, a private global forecasting firm. In 2009, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates appointed Kaplan to the Defense Policy Board, a federal advisory committee to the United States Department of Defense. In 2011, Foreign Policy magazine named Kaplan as one of the world's "top 100 global thinkers."

The convention that drafted the proposed constitution was composed of the elected members of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and the Governor's Council meeting as a single body.  The document drafted by this convention was approved in February 1778, and submitted to the voters of the state for ratification, the first constitution to be submitted for such a vote.  It was soundly rejected by voters, leading to a second convention in 1779, whose proposed constitution was accepted.

Text replacement, replace-as-you-type or AutoCorrect is an automatic data validation function commonly found in word processors and text editing interfaces for smartphones and tablet computers. Its principal purpose is as part of the spell checker to correct common spelling or typing errors, saving time for the user. It is also used to automatically format text or insert special characters by recognizing particular character usage, saving the user from having to use more tedious functions.
Additional options include recognizing words with two initial capital letters (e.g. "EXample") and correcting them, capitalizing the first letters of sentences, and correcting accidental use of caps lock (e.g. eXAMPLE).
The replacement list for text replacement can also be modified by the user, allowing the user to use shortcuts. If, for example, the user is writing an essay on the industrial revolution, a replacement key can be set up to replace "ir" with "industrial revolution", saving the user time whenever they want to type it. For users with the patience, this facility can even be used to create a complete keyboard shorthand system, along lines similar to those of Dutton Speedwords, but with short forms instantly replaced by full forms.
Some stand alone programs allow global text replacement across the operating system, and apply to text typed into any other application.
The list of terms within the default Microsoft AutoCorrect application in Microsoft Word can be replaced by words, terms, expressions, etc., other than the default set. Doing so in a wise, comprehensive and strategic manner can immensely improve the keyboarding productivity and accuracy in high-production work settings.
To get the most from the autocorrect routine, one may best exploit the fact that the most common words typed are the best candidates for which to deploy shortcuts. For example, using 
"t" for "the" ;
"w" for "with" ; 
etcetera can maximize the keystroke-to-production ratio.
Any system such as developing a technique requires a learning curve to achieve mastery, but experience in developing a database of expressions has proven that to ensure most effective use of autocorrect, shortcuts must be easy to recall.
For example, the threshold of characters in the chosen word is no less than three (3) except when the 2-letter word is within a longer expression, e.g., "aamof" for "as a matter of fact".
One technique in developing a system of large database of terms is using prefixes and suffixes in the formation of a shortcut.
For example, using the suffix "z" [mnemonic: expandZ] for the "asapz" to expand to "as "as soon as possible"
Whether one requires either a robust or moderate exploitation of the autocorrect, this feature may be best used by first deleting the default terms that are supplied by the manufacturer. Those default terms typically include those words most commonly mis-typed. Including those terms, e.g., "teh" for "the" invites careless and/or thoughtless actions whereas excluding them invites a learning process, or greater productivity.
In a robust exploitation of autocorrect, including chemical notation, the deployment could transcends the perceived "disadvantage" of autocorrect. The simple use of a shortcut suffix denoting chemical glossaries would be deployed. For example, using 
"campx" for "cAMP" and 
"camp¥" for "cyclic adenosine monophosphate" and 
"camp¥x" for "C10H12N5O6P" 
[with corresponding sub-script or super-script as needed] the shortcut "campx" with "cAMP"; furthermore if/when the full expression was needed, the developer could invoke ¥ to be the suffix for chemical notation, e.g., substitute .

Roger P. Sonnabend (September 17, 1925 – December 7, 2008) was an American hotelier and businessman. He was the head of Sonesta International Hotels Corporation.
Roger, the eldest of three brothers, graduated from MIT and took the helm at the Nautilus Hotel and Beach Club, in Atlantic Beach, New York, when he was 21. He graduated Harvard Business School in 1949.
The family business was known as Sonnabend Operated Hotels, which later merged with Childs Restaurant Group when A.M. Sonnabend purchased a controlling interest in Childs in 1955.  Childs was renamed Hotel Corporation of America when the Sonnabend Operated Hotels were merged with Childs.  Two prominent hotels included were the Plaza Hotel (New York) and the Mayflower Hotel (Washington DC).  Roger was promoted to President upon the death of his father, the founder of the chain.
In 1969, the company engaged an advertising agency to create a new brand name.  The agency felt the company already had a great name that was used by the Rib Room restaurants that operated at many of the hotels.  The name was Sonesta.  Sonesta is derived from "Sonny" and "Esther".  AM Sonnabend was known to many as "Sonny".  Among the many commercial interests of AM Sonnabend, was a Holstein dairy farm located in Massachusetts.  The Sonnabend's often enjoyed "bake potato Sonesta" when entertaining at the farm and the recipe was later used when serving baked potatoes at the Rib Room restaurants.  Baked potatoes Sonesta were topped with butter, sour cream and chives.  This popular American tradition was first introduced by the RIb Room restaurants.
Among the hotels managed by HCA was a 400-room luxury ocean-front hotel in Southampton Parish, Bermuda—originally named the Carlton Beach.  It became entangled in extensive litigation between the builder/owner, the J. Irwin Miller family, and HCA.  After a Court resolution that satisfied no one, the hotel was purchased by HCA and later renamed the Sonesta Beach.  It was demolished after suffering severe damage in a hurricane around 2005.

Roger's political work landed him on the master list of Nixon political opponents.

Implemented by Jan Wieck, PL/pgSQL first appeared with PostgreSQL 6.4, released on October 30, 1998. Version 9 also implements some ISO SQL/PSM features, like overloading of SQL-invoked functions and procedures.PL/pgSQL, as a fully featured programming language, allows much more procedural control than SQL, including the ability to use loops and other control structures. SQL statements and triggers can call functions created in the PL/pgSQL language.
The design of PL/pgSQL aimed to allow Postgresql users to perform more complex operations and computations than SQL, while providing ease of use. The language is able to be defined as trusted by the server.PL/pgSQL is the only programming language installed by default for PostgreSQL, but many others are available, including PL/Java, PL/Perl, PL/pgPSM, PL/php, PL/Python, PL/R,  PL/Ruby,PL/sh, 
PL/Tcl,
and PL/Lua.  PostgreSQL uses Bison as its parser,
making it easy to port many open-source languages, as well as to reuse code.

MAYA-II (Molecular Array of YES and ANDNOT logic gates) is a DNA computer, based on DNA Stem Loop Controllers, developed by scientists at Columbia University and the University of New Mexico and created in 2006.Replacing the normally silicon-based circuits, this chip has DNA strands to form the circuit. It is said that the speed of such DNA-circuited computer chips will rival and surpass the silicon-based ones, they will be of use in blood samples and in the body and might partake in single cell signaling.
It is the successor to the MAYA I which was composed of only 23 logic gates and could only complete specific games of tic-tac-toe.  MAYA-II has more than 100 DNA circuits and can now thoroughly play a game of tic-tac-toe.  It is very slow - one move in a game of tic-tac-toe can take up to 30 minutes making it more of a demonstration than an actual application.The arrangement of this device looks like that of a tic-tac-toe grid and consists of nine wells coated with culture cells. The logic gates are made of the E6 Deoxyribozymes (or DNAzyme) which react to specific oligonucleotide input. Upon reaction, the DNAzyme cleaves the substrate producing an increase in red or green fluorescence, depending on whether it is the computer's or the human's turn respectively.
This technology was used to deepen the quality of diagnostics given to patients infected with the West Nile virus. Joanne Macdonald, a Columbia University virologist, hopes this device can be implanted in the human body and control the presence of cancer cells or the levels of insulin for diabetic patients.
One of the suggested uses put forward by MAYA's creators is that technology such as this can be used in situations where fluid is involved, such as in a sample of blood or a body, since it does not use traditional silicon components.

Joop cannot forget his experiences in a concentration camp during World War II and these emotions are transferred to his wife Dina and their three children. The eldest son and daughter have long since lost contact with their parents and respond in the documentary only by letter. The youngest son Reinier, together with his wife Hadelinde, stayed in contact with his parents. Joop died in 2000, yet the camp experiences are seemingly 'inherited,' as Joop's descendants continue to pay the emotional price of his survival.

The United Kingdom National Debt is the total quantity of money borrowed by the Government of the United Kingdom at any time through the issue of securities by the British Treasury and other government agencies.
As of Q1 2015 UK government debt amounted to £1.56 trillion, or 81.58% of total GDP, at which time the annual cost of servicing (paying the interest) the public debt amounted to around £43bn (which is roughly 3% of GDP or 8% of UK government tax income). Approximately a third of this debt is owned by the British government due to the Bank of England's quantitative easing programme, so approximately 1/3 of the cost of servicing the debt is paid by the government to itself, reducing the annual servicing cost to approx £30bn (approx 2% of GDP, approx 5% of UK government tax income). In addition, interest payments spent can generate tax revenue further down the line.

Due to the Government's significant budget deficit, the national debt is increasing by approximately £73.5 billion per annum, or around £1.4 billion each week. As a result of its efforts to balance the budget, the Government forecast in 2014 that the structural deficit would be eliminated in the financial year 2017/18. However it changed the year to 2018/19 in March 2015 and to 2019/20 in July 2015. The Government's target to return the public finances to surplus by 2019/2020 was abandoned by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in July 2016.

"Doggy Dogg World" is the third and final single from Snoop Doggy Dogg's debut album Doggystyle. It is the first European-only release with an American video TV-play. It features 1970s era classic soul & R&B group The Dramatics, with guest rap verses from Kurupt and Daz Dillinger (Tha Dogg Pound), and chorus singing by background vocalist Nancy Fletcher. It samples Richard "Dimples" Fields' "If It Ain't One Thing, It's Another" from his 1982 album Mr. Look So Good.  The song's title is a reference to a common eggcorn of the phrase "Dog-Eat-Dog World."

Ruins is a Japanese music duo composed only of drummer/vocalist Tatsuya Yoshida and a bass guitarist (there have been four such bassists in the band's history). The group, formed in 1985, was supposedly intended to be a power trio; the guitarist, however, never showed up to the band's first rehearsal so the group remained a duo. The music touches on progressive rock, jazz fusion and noise rock.
The French progressive rock band Magma is the group's most important influence, to such an extent that Ruins' original lyrics are written and sung in an invented language which, at first glance, resembles Kobaïan, the language invented by Christian Vander of Magma.  Ruins' material (which Yoshida, who composes the majority of their pieces, writes out in score form) is generally of extreme complexity and thus is often described as inaccessible; potential listeners may be bewildered by the band's unrestrained yet disciplined approach. 
In addition to the "prog rock" label, the group's music has also been described as "math rock" and "zeuhl".  That said, Ruins' style has consistently evolved since the band's beginning, often changing according to the bassist that Tatsuya was collaborating with at the time. 
Ruins have collaborated with several other musicians, including prominent avant-garde figure Derek Bailey, auteur guitarist/multi-instrumentalist Keiji Haino and Ground Zero alumnus Kazuhisa Uchihashi.
Sasaki Hisashi left the band in 2004, and since then Yoshida has been touring solo under the name Ruins-alone (Ruins Alone). He has also performed as Sax Ruins with alto saxophonist Ono Ryoko. He was chosen by Matt Groening to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival Groening curated in May 2010 in Minehead, England.

On September 6, 2016, Tatsuya announced via his Facebook that third period bassist Masuda Ryuichi would be rejoining the band for a show in December and shows throughout the spring.

The Lucas critique, named for Robert Lucas's work on macroeconomic policymaking, argues that it is naive to try to predict the effects of a change in economic policy entirely on the basis of relationships observed in historical data, especially highly aggregated historical data. More formally, it states that the decision rules of Keynesian models—such as the consumption function—cannot be considered as structural in the sense of being invariant with respect to changes in government policy variables. The Lucas critique is significant in the history of economic thought as a representative of the paradigm shift that occurred in macroeconomic theory in the 1970s towards attempts at establishing micro-foundations.

The Andy Williams Christmas Album is the first Christmas holiday album released by singer Andy Williams.  It was issued by Columbia Records in 1963, and it would prove to be the first of eight Christmas albums released by Williams. Though it was also the album that introduced Williams' perennial holiday classic "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year", Columbia instead opted to release Williams' cover of "White Christmas" as the album's promotional single at the time.A front-page story in Billboard magazine on Nov. 23, 1963, made clear the album was already destined to be a big hit, reporting: "Though the majority of retailers around the country that were contacted reported that Christmas product sales were just starting, they have already singled out the new 'Andy Williams Christmas Album' as the probably No. 1 LP for the next two months; at least of those albums thus far on the market. It is already registering heavy sales, as is his single 'White Christmas.'"From 1963 to 1973, Billboard published special weekly Christmas Albums and Christmas Singles sales charts.  For all five weeks that these special charts were published in 1963 (for the weeks ending November 30, 1963 through December 28, 1963), The Andy Williams Christmas Album was the number one selling Christmas album, while Williams' cover of "White Christmas" was the number one selling Christmas single.  The Andy Williams Christmas Album spent three weeks as the number one selling Christmas album during the holiday season of 1964, and one week as the number one selling Christmas album during the holiday season of 1965.  It charted on Billboard's Christmas Albums chart at least one week for each of the years that the chart was published.
On December 14, 1964, The Andy Williams Christmas Album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of 500,000 copies in the United States. The album was reissued with a different cover in the UK in 1975 and was awarded Silver certification by the British Phonographic Industry in 1976 for selling 60,000 units. Platinum certification in the United States was awarded on November 21, 1986.

Thanatos is a darkwave band whose recordings are distributed by Projekt Records. The band's origins trace to the mid 1980s and was a studio project of Patrick Ogle (aka Padraic Ogl) and Sam Rosenthal (black tape for a blue girl).
They released their first album, This Endless Night Inside in 1993, a second, An Embassy to Gaius (1997) and a final recording Blisters (1997). Another record by the band, under the name Illegalteenagebikini appeared (and disappeared) in 2002. The band's recordings featured work by Sam Rosenthal of Black Tape for a Blue Girl and William Tucker of Ministry. Thanatos released a digital only LP, "The Exterminating Angel" in 2013 (after working on it for nearly 10 years) and is set to release a crowdfunded LP, "The Coyote in the Graveyard" in 2015.
Rosenthal ran the fanzine Alternative Rhythms in South Florida and Ogle wrote for the magazine as a concert and record reviewer. The two had been friends since  middle school. After releasing a cassette (most of which can be heard as hidden tracks on the band's first LP) the band went into hibernation. During this time piece of Ogle can be heard on various black tape for a blue girl LPs. The title track of the LP "this lush garden within" began life as a Thanatos song.  The group became a live act in 1995 after the release of their second LP with the addition of Tucker and Polcyn.

The Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkish: Halkların Demokratik Partisi (HDP), Kurdish: Partiya Demokratîk a Gelan), or Democratic Party of the Peoples, is a pro-Kurdish and pro-minority political party in Turkey. Generally left-wing, the party places a strong emphasis on participatory democracy, minority rights,  and egalitarianism. It is an associate member of the Party of European Socialists (PES) and consultative member of the Socialist International.
Aspiring to fundamentally challenge the existing Turkish-Kurdish divide and other existing parameters in Turkish politics, the HDP was founded in 2012 as the political wing of the Peoples' Democratic Congress, a union of numerous left-wing movements that had previously fielded candidates as independents to bypass the 10% election threshold. It is in alliance with the Kurdish Democratic Regions Party (DBP), often described as the HDP's fraternal party. While the HDP's claims that it represents the whole of Turkey, critics have accused the party of mainly representing the interests of the Kurdish minority in south-eastern Turkey, where the party polls the highest. From 2013 to 2015, the HDP participated in peace negotiations with the Turkish government on behalf of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) separatist militant organisation, with which it is accused of having direct links.

The party operates a co-presidential system of leadership, with one chairman and one chairwoman. As of 22 June 2014, these chairpersons are Selahattin Demirtaş and Figen Yüksekdağ respectively. In the 2014 presidential election, the party put forward its chairman, Selahattin Demirtaş, who won 9.77% of the vote. Despite concerns that it could fall short of the 10% election threshold,  the party put forward party-lists instead of running independent candidates the subsequent June 2015 general election. Exceeding expectations, it polled at 13.12%, becoming the third largest parliamentary group. The party briefly participated in the interim election government formed by AKP Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu on 28 August 2015, with HDP MPs Ali Haydar Konca and Müslüm Doğan becoming the Minister of European Union Affairs and the Minister of Development respectively.

The Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major, Op. 97, also known as the Rhenish, is the last symphony composed by Robert Schumann (1810–1856), although not the last published. It was composed from 2 November to 9 December 1850, and comprises five movements:

Lebhaft
Scherzo: Sehr mäßig (in C major)
Nicht schnell (in A-flat major)
Feierlich (in E-flat minor)
Lebhaft
The Third Symphony is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in B♭, two bassoons, four french horns in E♭, two trumpets in E♭, three trombones, timpani and strings. It premiered on 6 February 1851 in Düsseldorf, conducted by Schumann himself, and was received with mixed reviews, "ranging from praise without qualification to bewilderment". However, according to Peter A. Brown, members of the audience applauded between every movement, and especially at the end of the work when the orchestra joined them in congratulating Schumann by shouting "hurrah!".

The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), nicknamed Baby, was the world's first stored-program computer. It was built at the Victoria University of Manchester, England, by Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill, and ran its first program on 21 June 1948.The machine was not intended to be a practical computer but was instead designed as a testbed for the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory. Although considered "small and primitive" by the standards of its time, it was the first working machine to contain all the elements essential to a modern electronic computer. As soon as the SSEM had demonstrated the feasibility of its design, a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer, the Manchester Mark 1. The Mark 1 in turn quickly became the prototype for the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.
The SSEM had a 32-bit word length and a memory of 32 words. As it was designed to be the simplest possible stored-program computer, the only arithmetic operations implemented in hardware were subtraction and negation; other arithmetic operations were implemented in software. The first of three programs written for the machine found the highest proper divisor of 218 (262,144), a calculation that was known would take a long time to run—and so prove the computer's reliability—by testing every integer from 218 − 1 downwards, as division was implemented by repeated subtraction of the divisor. The program consisted of 17 instructions and ran for 52 minutes before reaching the correct answer of 131,072, after the SSEM had performed 3.5 million operations (for an effective CPU speed of 1.1 kIPS).

Microchess, by Peter R. Jennings, was originally a microcomputer chess program for the MOS Technology KIM-1 microcomputer, first released on December 18, 1976. Microchess, as small as it was in terms of program size, could still play passable chess on the KIM-1 with its 6502 microprocessor, 1 kilobyte of memory, simple hex keyboard, and seven-segment display.
Selling it at a price of US$10, Jennings refused to sell the rights of the program to Chuck Peddle (president of MOS Technology) for $1000. It was the first software package to sell 50,000 copies. Jennings founded Personal Software to publish Microchess to the growing microcomputer market. Money made from Microchess and other software projects allowed Jennings, together with Dan Fylstra, to launch VisiCalc and then create the VisiCorp company. VisiCalc was be its greatest success.

Microchess was later expanded into a more fully featured program with graphics for the TRS-80, Apple II, Commodore PET and Atari 400/800 computers. It was also licensed to Novag for its dedicated Chess Champion Mk II in 1979.

"Long, Long Ago" is a song dealing with nostalgia, written in 1833 by English composer Thomas Haynes Bayly. Originally called "The Long Ago", its name was apparently changed by the editor Rufus Wilmot Griswold when it was first published, posthumously, in a Philadelphia magazine, along with a collection of other songs and poems by Bayly. The song was well received, and became one of the most popular songs in the United States in 1844.
In 1939 the tune was given new words (revised slightly in 1941) and a bouncier tempo.  It became the 1942 Glenn Miller hit "Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree (With Anyone Else but Me)".
In 1950, Patti Page recorded a cover as an alternate flip side to her hit record, "Tennessee Waltz".

Medical resident work hours refers to the (often lengthy) shifts worked by medical interns and residents during their medical residency.
In many locations, trainee doctors commonly work 80 to 100 hours a week, with residents occasionally logging 136 (out of 168) hours in a week. Some studies show that about 40% of this work is not direct patient care, but ancillary care, such as paperwork. Trainee doctors are often not paid on an hourly basis, but on a fixed salary; in some locations, they are paid for booked overtime.

Limits on working hours have led to misreporting, where the resident works more hours than they record.

Glee is an American musical comedy-drama television series that aired on the Fox network in the United States from May 19, 2009, to March 20, 2015. It focuses on the fictitious William McKinley High School glee club, New Directions, which competes on the show choir competition circuit while its disparate members deal with social issues, especially regarding sexuality and race, relationships, and learning to become an effective team. The initial twelve-member cast included club director and Spanish teacher Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), Will's wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), and eight club members played by Dianna Agron, Chris Colfer, Kevin McHale, Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, Amber Riley, Mark Salling, and Jenna Ushkowitz. In subsequent seasons, the main cast has expanded to fourteen and fifteen members.
The series was created by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan, the latter of whom first conceived of Glee as a film. The three wrote all of the show's episodes for the first two seasons, and Murphy and Falchuk initially served as the show's main directors. The pilot episode was broadcast on May 19, 2009, and the first season aired from September 9, 2009, to June 8, 2010. Subsequent seasons aired in September through May. The sixth and final season aired from January to March 2015. Glee features on-screen performance-based musical numbers that were selected by Murphy, who aimed to maintain a balance between show tunes and chart hits, and produced by Adam Anders and Peer Åström. Songs covered in the show were released through the iTunes Store during the week of broadcast, and a series of Glee albums have been released by Columbia Records. The music of Glee has been a commercial success, with over thirty-six million digital single sales and eleven million album sales worldwide through October 2011. The series' merchandise also includes DVD and Blu-ray releases, an iPad application, and karaoke games for the Wii. There were live concert tours by the show's cast after the first and second seasons completed shooting; a concert film based on the 2011 tour, Glee: The 3D Concert Movie, was produced by Murphy and Fox and directed by Kevin Tancharoen.
During its first season, Glee received generally favorable reviews from critics, with Metacritic's weighted average of 77 out of 100 based on eighteen critical reviews. The season was nominated for nineteen Emmy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, six Satellite Awards and fifty-seven other awards, with wins including the 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy, and Emmy awards for Jane Lynch, guest-star Neil Patrick Harris and Murphy's direction of the pilot episode. In 2011, the show once again won the Golden Globe for Best Television Series, and Jane Lynch and Chris Colfer won Golden Globes for Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor respectively, and Gwyneth Paltrow won the Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. The show was also chosen by Fox to fill the coveted time slot that followed the network's coverage of Super Bowl XLV in 2011.

On October 17, 2013, in the wake of the death of Cory Monteith three months prior, and one week after his tribute episode "The Quarterback" aired, Murphy announced that the sixth season would be the final one of the series. After 121 episodes and over 728 music performances, Glee came to an end on March 20, 2015.

A jigsaw puzzle is a tiling puzzle that requires the assembly of often oddly shaped interlocking and tessellating pieces.
Each piece usually has a small part of a picture on it; when complete, a jigsaw puzzle produces a complete picture. In some cases more advanced types have appeared on the market, such as spherical jigsaws and puzzles showing optical illusions.
Jigsaw puzzles were originally created by painting a picture on a flat, rectangular piece of wood, and then cutting that picture into small pieces with a jigsaw, hence the name. John Spilsbury, a London cartographer and engraver, is credited with commercializing jigsaw puzzles around 1760. Jigsaw puzzles have since come to be made primarily of cardboard.
Typical images found on jigsaw puzzles include scenes from nature, buildings, and repetitive designs. Castles and mountains are two traditional subjects. However, any kind of picture can be used to make a jigsaw puzzle; some companies offer to turn personal photographs into puzzles. Completed puzzles can also be attached to a backing with adhesive to be used as artwork.

During recent years, a range of jigsaw puzzle accessories including boards, cases, frames and roll-up mats has become available that are designed to assist jigsaw puzzle enthusiasts.

Videocracy is a 2009 documentary film directed by Swedish-Italian Erik Gandini about Italian television and its impact on Italian culture and politics, and about Silvio Berlusconi's powerful position on all of these. Gandini coined the phrase "The Evilness of Banality" to describe the cultural phenomenon of Berlusconismo, thus making a word play on Hanna Arendt's "Banality of Evil".
Soon after its theatrical premiere in Sweden, the film was shown at the 66th Venice International Film Festival where it gained massive attention. The trailer for the film has been banned by most Italian television broadcasters.Videocracy uses the theme song for Silvio Berlusconi's presidential campaign, and now party theme, Meno male che Silvio c'è! (loosely translated: Thank God for Silvio!). When first hearing it the film's director Erik Gandini thought it was satire.
Videocracy has won awards at the Toronto International Film Festival, Sheffield Doc/Fest, the Golden Graal awards, and the Tempo Documentary Award of 2010. Videocracy was widely distributed internationally, seeing theatrical release in  the USA, UK, the Netherlands, France, Poland, and Sweden among other countries. In Italy, where it opened in 90 theaters across the country on the weekend of 4 September 2009, Videocracy came in 4th in box office rankings.

A variety of conspiracy theories have been proposed regarding the Oklahoma City bombing. These theories reject all, or part of, the official government report. Some of these theories focus on the possibility of additional, unindicted, co-conspirators or additional explosives planted inside the Murrah Federal building. Other theories allege that government employees and officials, including US President Bill Clinton, knew of the impending bombing and intentionally failed to act on that knowledge. Government investigations have been opened at various times to look into the theories.

The Mirage Tavern was a drinking establishment  at 731 N. Wells St. in Chicago purchased by the Chicago Sun-Times in 1977 to investigate widespread allegations of official corruption and shakedowns visited on small businesses by city officials. The journalists used hidden cameras to help ensure that city inspectors caught accepting payoffs for ignoring safety hazards were all properly documented.In 1978, the Sun-Times broke the story in a 25-part series that documented the many abuses and crimes committed at the tavern, which was shaken down repeatedly by state and local officials. The series was initially nominated for the Pulitzer Prize  for general reporting, but the Pulitzer board decided not to award the Sun-Times when editor Ben Bradlee of the Washington Post led an attack on the grounds that the reporters used undercover reporting, a form of deception, to report the story.The Mirage gave rise to major reforms including city code revisions, new procedures in city inspections and investigations at federal, state and city levels. The IRS sent in 20 agents to take a closer look at tax fraud by cash businesses. The Illinois Department of Revenue formed a new investigative unit: the Mirage Audit Unit.  An ongoing federal investigation, spurred by the Mirage findings, managed indictments of a third of the city’s electrical inspectors in 1978, with more indictments to come later.
The project was overseen by editors James Hoge, Ralph Otwell, Stuart H. Loory and Joseph Reilly. In May 1977, journalist Pam Zekman and Better Government Association chief investigator Bill Recktenwald purchased the tavern under the aliases Mr. and Mrs. Ray Patterson. Reporter Zay N. Smith, who wrote the series, and BGA investigator Jeff Allen posed as the bartender and manager, respectively. Sun-Times photographers Gene Pesek and Jim Frost were in charge of photographing the tavern's activities from a hidden section of the tavern built over the washrooms.Corrupt practices ran the gamut from shakedowns to tax fraud. 
The shakedown amounts were small, typically less than $100, as the reporters learned of what they later called "the supermarket approach to graft--low prices, high volume" that inspectors tended to prefer as the safest way of doing illegal business.
Among others, a city electrical inspector agreed to overlook the tavern's faulty wiring. A fire department lieutenant agreed to sign off on the tavern's grand opening, despite the loose electrical wiring hanging from rafters and a basement piled high with trash against regulations. A city health inspector ignored maggots and sink drains that emptied down to the basement floor. A state liquor inspector ignored fruit flies in the liquor.
(The tavern quietly corrected all its code violations, on its own, after the shakedown inspections.)
Also reported were illegal kickbacks from pinball operators and jukebox operators (A.A. Swingtime Music Company), as well as tax skimming. Philip J. Barasch, a local accountant, gave the new owners of the bar extensive lessons on how to keep two sets of account books to skim profits without paying tax and advised them exactly what time of day inspectors showed up and how much their shakedowns would typically cost. He also suggested including his business card with any payoffs to help smooth the shakedown process. The only officials he warned against bribing were the police, noting that "if you pay off a cop, they keep coming around every month, like flies, looking for a payoff". The Mirage, after hearing Barash's tax advice, hired six more accountants specializing in small cash businesses and was counseled by all of them to commit fraud.

The tavern, which has had more than one owner since the Sun-Times investigation, is now known, after a number of improvements, as the Brehon Pub.

New Zealand First is a conservative and populist political party in New Zealand. It was founded in July 1993, following the 19 March 1993 resignation of its leader and founder, Winston Peters, from the then-governing National Party. It has formed governments with both major parties in New Zealand: first with the National Party from 1996 to 1998, and then with the Labour Party from 2005 to 2008.
Commentators dispute the appropriate classification of the party on the traditional political spectrum, but many New Zealanders associate it with advocacy of senior citizens' benefits, and opposition to immigration, especially from Asia.
The party held seats in the House of Representatives of New Zealand from its formation in 1993 until 2008, when it failed to gain enough party votes to retain representation.  However, in the 2011 election, New Zealand First gained 6.59% of the total party vote, entitling it to eight Members of Parliament (MPs).

The party sits on the cross-benches and during the 50th New Zealand Parliament tended to vote with the Opposition against Government policies.

"Me & the Rhythm" is a song recorded by American singer Selena Gomez from her second solo studio album Revival (2015). It was released on October 2, 2015 on iTunes and other digital download platforms as the album's first and only promotional single. Written by Gomez, Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels and its producers Mattman & Robin, "Me & the Rhythm" was the last song to be recorded for Revival after a request made by Gomez to work four more days with its songwriters and it is one of Gomez's favorite songs on that album.
"Me & the Rhythm" was inspired by disco music, dance music and synthpop, and features steel drums, deep house beats, "pulsating" percussion and "smoky" synths in its instrumentation. Lyrically, the song talks about losing yourself on the dance floor and being able to be free within the moment and within one's self. The song was acclaimed by critics, with many praising its vintage disco sound and Gomez's sultry vocals. Gomez performed the song in a medley with "Come & Get It" during her set on The Today Show.

Dynamic frequency scaling (also known as CPU throttling) is a technique in computer architecture whereby the frequency of a microprocessor can be automatically adjusted "on the fly", either to conserve power or to reduce the amount of heat generated by the chip. Dynamic frequency scaling is commonly used in laptops and other mobile devices, where energy comes from a battery and thus is limited. It is also used in quiet computing settings and to decrease energy and cooling costs for lightly loaded machines. Less heat output, in turn, allows the system cooling fans to be throttled down or turned off, reducing noise levels and further decreasing power consumption. It is also used for reducing heat in insufficiently cooled systems when the temperature reaches a certain threshold, such as in poorly cooled overclocked systems.
The dynamic power (switching power) dissipated per unit of time by a chip is C·V2·A·f, where C is the capacitance being switched per clock cycle, V is voltage, A is the Activity Factor indicating the average number of switching events undergone by the transistors in the chip (as a unitless quantity) and f is the switching frequency. The voltage required for stable operation is determined by the frequency at which the circuit is clocked, and can be reduced if the frequency is also reduced. Dynamic power does not account for the total power of the chip, however, as there is also static power, which is primarily because of various leakage currents. Due to static power consumption and asymptotic execution time it has been shown that the energy consumption of a piece of software shows convex energy behavior, i.e., there exists an optimal CPU frequency at which energy consumption is minimal.Leakage current has become more and more important as transistor sizes have become smaller and threshold voltage levels lower. A decade ago, dynamic power accounted for approximately two-thirds of the total chip power. The power loss due to leakage currents in contemporary CPUs and SoCs tend to dominate the total power consumption. In the attempt to control the leakage power high-k metal-gates and power gating have been common methods.
Dynamic voltage scaling is another power conservation technique that is often used in conjunction with frequency scaling, as the frequency that a chip may run at is related to the operating voltage.

The efficiency of some electrical components, such as voltage regulators, decreases with increasing temperature, so the power usage may increase with temperature.  Since increasing power use may increase the temperature, increases in voltage or frequency may increase system power demands even further than the CMOS formula indicates, and vice versa.

The surface-area-to-volume ratio, also called the surface-to-volume ratio and variously denoted sa/vol or SA:V, is the amount of surface area per unit volume of an object or collection of objects.
In chemical reactions involving a solid material, the surface area to volume ratio is an important factor for the reactivity, that is, the rate at which the chemical reaction will proceed.
For a given volume, the object with the smallest surface area (and therefore with the smallest SA:V) is the sphere, a consequence of the isoperimetric inequality in 3 dimensions. By contrast, objects with tiny spikes will have very large surface area for a given volume.
If a cell is too large, not enough materials will be able to cross the membrane fast enough to accommodate the high cellular volume

In algebraic geometry, the Chow group of a stack is a generalization of the Chow group of a variety or scheme to stacks. For quotient stacks, it is closely related to the equivariant Chow group.
One difference from a usual Chow group is that a cycle may carry non-trivial automorphisms and consequently intersection-theoretic operations must take this into account. For example, the degree of a 0-cycle on a stack need not be an integer but is a rational number (due to non-trivial stabilizers).

The uniform tilings are the simplest application of these mutations, although more complex patterns can be expressed within a fundamental domain.

Workers' Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores, PRT) is a Panamanian political party.
The PRT was created in October 1983. Prior to the 1984 balloting, it joined with a number of trade union organizations in a coalition styled the United People's Electoral Front (FREPU), which neither the People’s Party of Panama or the Workers' Socialist Party chose to join. 

“This Trotskyist organization criticized but supported the Manuel Noriega regime and urged it to follow the nationalist policies of the Omar Torrijos government, especially the building of popular democracy. Led by Graciela Dixon the PRT encouraged the government to strengthen the role of the masses in the political process”.

The PRT vehemently opposed the Manuel Noriega-led National Democratic Union coalition in 1984 and ran its own candidate, José Renán Esquivel, for president.

The PNP was abolished by the Electoral Tribunal in November 1984.

A community is "a body of people or things viewed collectively". According to Steven Brint, communities are "aggregates of people who share common activities and/or beliefs and who are bound together principally by relations of affect, loyalty, common values, and/or personal concern – i.e., interest in the personalities and life events of one another".Jenny Preece suggested to evaluate communities according to physical features: size, location and the boundaries that confined them. When commuting became a way of life and cheaper transportation made it easier for people to join multiple communities to satisfy different needs, the strength and type of relationships among people seemed more promising criteria.Since social capital is built of trust, rules, norms and networks, it can be said that the social capital of communities has grown. The lower entrance barriers to the community have made it easier to be a part of many different communities. This goes hand in hand with Don Tapscott's theory of how the digital society has changed collaboration and innovation to a world of co-creation.From birth to death, people are shaped by the communities to which they belong, affecting everything from how they talk to whom they talk with. Just like the telephone and the television changed the way people interact socially, computers have transformed communication and at the same time created new norms for social capital.
"A virtual community is a group of people who may or may not meet one another face to face, who exchange words and ideas through the mediation of computer bulletin board systems and other digital networks". Along with the fact that computer usage has spread, the use of virtual communities have grown. Rheingold defines virtual communities as "social aggregations that emerge from the Net when enough people carry on those public discussions long enough, with sufficient human feeling, to form webs of personal relationships in cyberspace". Michael Porter describes a virtual community as "an aggregation of individuals or business partners who interact around a shared interest, where the interaction is at least partially supported and/or mediated by technology and guided by some protocols or norms".
Virtual communities consist of "people with shared interests or goals for whom electronic communication is a primary form of interaction" and have created new forms of collaboration. "The most skilled and experienced members of the community provide leadership and help integrate contributions from the community as a whole. This way, virtual communities can use the voluntary motivations that exist in a community to assign the right person to the right task more effectively than traditional forms".According to Benkler, we can "see a thickening of the preexisting relations with friends and family, in particular with those who were hard to reach earlier". "Also, we are beginning to see the emergence of a greater scope for limited-purpose, loose relationships. Although these may not fit the ideal model of virtual communities, they are effective and meaningful to their participants".

The heightened individual capacity that actually is a driving social force have raised concerns by many that the Internet is further fragmenting the community, making people spend their time in front of their computer instead of socializing with each other. Empirical studies show, however, that we are using the Internet and communities on the expense of television, and that is an exchange that promotes social ties.

That Lady is a 1955 film directed by Terence Young. It stars Olivia de Havilland, Gilbert Roland and Paul Scofield.
The film is based on a 1946 historical novel by Kate O'Brien, which was published in North America under the title For One Sweet Grape. It is the story of  Ana de Mendoza, a swashbuckling, sword-toting princess. She lost an eye in a duel defending the honor of her king Philip II of Spain, (played by Scofield, who earned a BAFTA award for his portrayal of the King). Philip later jilted her to marry Mary I, the Queen of England. Subsequently, he asks Ana de Mendoza to assist him, as his popularity starts to drop off.
Shot in England and on location in Spain, the film features Cinemascope footage of the Spanish countryside and renaissance castles. That Lady was an early directorial effort by Terence Young who went on to direct three James Bond films: Dr. No, From Russia With Love, and Thunderball. Christopher Lee appears in a minor role as the Captain of the Guard.

The novel was also produced as a play in 1949.

In the mathematical fields of general topology and descriptive set theory, a meagre set (also called a meager set or a set of first category) is a set that, considered as a subset of a (usually larger) topological space, is in a precise sense small or negligible.  The meagre subsets of a fixed space form a σ-ideal of subsets; that is, any subset of a meagre set is meagre, and the union of countably many meagre sets is meagre.
General topologists use the term Baire space to refer to a broad class of topological spaces on which the notion of meagre set is not trivial (in particular, the entire space is not meagre).  Descriptive set theorists mostly study meagre sets as subsets of the real numbers, or more generally any Polish space, and reserve the term Baire space for one particular Polish space.
The complement of a meagre set is a comeagre set or residual set.

In economics and game theory, an all-pay auction is an auction in which every bidder must pay regardless of whether they win the prize, which is awarded to the highest bidder as in a conventional auction.

In an all-pay auction, the Nash equilibrium is such that each bidder plays a mixed strategy and their expected pay-off is zero.  The seller's expected revenue is equal to the value of the prize. However, some experiments have shown that over-bidding is common. That is, the seller's revenue frequently exceeds that of the value of the prize, and in repeated games even bidders that win the prize frequently will most likely make a loss in the long run.

Code Reading (ISBN 0-201-79940-5) is a 2003 software development book written by Diomidis Spinellis.
The book is directed to programmers who want to improve their code reading abilities.
It discusses specific techniques for reading code written by others and outlines common programming concepts.
The code examples used in the book are taken from real-life software, many of them coming from the export-19980407 NetBSD snapshot. Although the programming language of choice is claimed to be balanced, the use of C to illustrate basic concepts predominates. Excerpts from important open-source code systems like the
Apache Web server,
the hsqldb Java relational database engine,
the NetBSD Unix distribution,
the Perl language,
the Tomcat application server,
and the X Window System are presented.
The book covers
most concepts related to code that are likely to appear before a software developer's eyes, including
programming constructs,
data types,
data structures,
control flow, project organization,
coding standards,
documentation, and
architectures.
A compact disc with 16 million lines of open-source code, accompanying the book, provides the context for all the presented examples.
The end chapters may be the ones of most use to advanced users, as the initial chapters delve into programming language constructs, regular expressions, etc.
The book inaugurated Addison-Wesley's Effective Software Development Series, edited by Scott Meyers,
and received the 2004 Software Development Productivity Award in the “Technical Books” category.
It has been translated into Chinese, Greek, Japanese, Korean, Polish, and Russian.

The song is best known in a recording by The Everly Brothers, issued by Cadence Records as catalog number 1337. The Everly Brothers record reached number one on the Billboard Pop chart and the Cash Box Best Selling Records chart, despite having been banned from Boston radio stations for lyrics that, at the time, were considered suggestive, according to a 1986 interview with Don Everly. "Wake Up Little Susie" also spent seven weeks atop the Billboard country chart and got to number two on the UK Singles Chart. The song was ranked at #318 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.
In an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show during the 2000 U.S. presidential election, then-Governor George W. Bush named "Wake Up Little Susie" as his favorite song. "Wake Up Little Susie" was the first single filmmaker David Lynch bought.

A passive speaker (also referred to as a receptive bilingual or passive bilingual) is a category of speaker who has had enough exposure to a language in childhood to have a native-like comprehension of it, but has little or no active command of it. 
Such speakers are especially common in language shift communities where speakers of a declining language do not acquire active competence. Around 10% of the Ainu people who speak the language are considered passive speakers. Passive speakers are often targeted in language revival efforts to increase the number of speakers of a language quickly, as they are likely to gain active and near-native speaking skills more quickly than those with no knowledge of the language. They are also found in areas where people grow up hearing another language outside their family with no formal education.

Bump mapping is a technique in computer graphics for simulating bumps and wrinkles on the surface of an object. This is achieved by perturbing the surface normals of the object and using the perturbed normal during lighting calculations. The result is an apparently bumpy surface rather than a smooth surface although the surface of the underlying object is not actually changed. Bump mapping was introduced by James Blinn in 1978.
Normal mapping is the most common variation of bump mapping used.

Allan Pettersson wrote his Symphony No. 9 in 1970.
The symphony is his last composition preceding a nine-month stay in hospital (starting September 1970); it is also his longest symphony.  There is one movement, though it divides into a number of smaller sections that follow each other with at most nominal pause but usually none.  The notes to the cpo recording identify 17 such sections, partially for analysis.Much though not all of the material in the symphony is based on the ascending scale motif heard at the very beginning, played by bassoons, violas and cellos. The concluding bars of the symphony are described by Peter Ruzicka as a Canto whose main theme goes from violins and cellos to violas in unison, and which ends in a slow cadence into F major.
Pettersson dedicated the symphony to Sergiu Comissiona and the Gothenburg Symphony, who premiered it on 18 February 1971  and had commissioned it for the 350th Anniversary of the Founding of the City of Gothenburg.
The miniature score was published in 1989 by Nordiska Musikforlaget of Stockholm and runs to 385 pages.

Following revelations by Edward Snowden about the activities of the United States' National Security Agency, and their PRISM surveillance programme, rising concerns about misuse of data lead to various proposals to enable citizens and consumers outside of the US to enjoy protection through technological sovereignty.

Contemporary society, according to social and political scientists, is characterised by at least three fundamental directions:

 increasing human interconnection through a network of relationships that is progressively covering the whole planet;
 the pace and depth of the evolution of human ways of life determined by technological innovation represent an absolute novelty in human history;
 the scale of anthropological and ecological transformation due to the interaction between evolutionary factors (social, cultural, economic, and technological) has no historical precedent.These presentations are the result of a number of fundamental changes that are irreversibly transforming our daily lives, our way of thinking and perceiving the world and our way of living together. Among these fundamental changes are: improvements in life conditions, life expectancy, literacy and gender equality; changes in domestic and international political institutions; and the breakdown of natural equilibria.

He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul!
The "Lily of the Valley," in Him alone I see,—
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole:
In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay;
He tells me ev'ry care on Him to Roll;

He's the "Lily of the Valley," the Bright and Morning Star;
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

"Judas" is a song by American recording artist Lady Gaga, from her second studio album, Born This Way (2011). It was released four days ahead of schedule by Interscope Records on April 15, 2011. Written and produced by Lady Gaga and RedOne, "Judas" is a dance and electro house song about a woman in love with a man who betrayed her. It embodies the incidents that have haunted Gaga in the past, and its core meaning refers to the negative parts of her life that she cannot escape. Gaga has further explained that the song was also about honoring one's inner darkness in order to bring oneself into the light. The artwork for the single was designed by Gaga in Microsoft Word. In spite of a polarizing impact on several religious groups, the song was generally well received by critics, who likened the song to "Bad Romance" with some noting it should have been the album's lead single.
"Judas" received generally positive reviews from most music critics. The song has a similar sound to Gaga's previous RedOne-produced tracks, including "Poker Face", "LoveGame", "Bad Romance", and "Alejandro". It contains three distinct hooks and a house-influenced break down. Gaga explained that the lines spoken during the breakdown talk about her as beyond redemption, regarding the traditional views of what a woman should be.  "Judas" initially had a strong sales opening, but was less successful commercially in comparison to Gaga's previous singles. The song reached the top ten of the charts in most major music markets, and also reached the top of the charts in South Korea.

A music video for the song was filmed in April 2011, co-directed by Gaga and Laurieann Gibson and co-starring Norman Reedus. It has a Biblical storyline where Reedus played Judas Iscariot and Gaga played Mary Magdalene. The video portrays them as modern day missionaries going to Jerusalem. It included the Biblical story of Judas betraying Jesus, and ended with Gaga as Magdalene getting stoned to death. Before its release, the Catholic League condemned Gaga for the use of religious imagery and her role in the video. However, the video was generally praised by critics and nominated for two awards at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. Gaga has performed "Judas" on a number of television shows, including The Graham Norton Show, Saturday Night Live, Good Morning America's "Summer Concert Series", the French X Factor as well as on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.

Béatrice et Bénédict (Beatrice and Benedick) is an opéra comique in two acts by Hector Berlioz. Berlioz wrote the French libretto himself, based closely on Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing.
Berlioz had been interested in setting Shakespeare's comedy since his return from Italy in 1833, but only composed the score of Béatrice et Bénédict following the completion of Les Troyens in 1858. It was first performed at the Theater der Stadt, Baden-Baden on 9 August 1862. Berlioz conducted the first two performances of a German version in Weimar in 1863, where, as he wrote in his memoirs, he was "overwhelmed by all sorts of kind attention."
It is the first notable version of Shakespeare's play in operatic form, and was followed by works by among others Árpád Doppler, Paul Puget and Reynaldo Hahn.
Berlioz biographer David Cairns has written: "Listening to the score's exuberant gaiety, only momentarily touched by sadness, one would never guess that its composer was in pain when he wrote it and impatient for death".

The following is a list of songs known to have been recorded by AC/DC. Since 1974 they have released 16 studio albums (14 available worldwide and 2 released only in Australia), 2 soundtrack albums, 4 live albums, 11 video albums, and 2 box set albums. Although a large number of AC/DC singles have been released, the band always refused to release any greatest hits type packages; Who Made Who (which served as the soundtrack to Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive), Iron Man 2, and the band's various live recordings are as close as the group have come to such a compilation. AC/DC albums are available to download from Verizon, but for several years the band refused to release their albums on iTunes, as iTunes normally allows downloading of individual tracks; AC/DC publicly stated, "Our ... reason is that we honestly believe the songs on any of our albums belong together. If we were on iTunes, we know a certain percentage of people would only download two or three songs from the album – and we don't think that represents us musically." However, the band finally released their entire discography to iTunes in November 2012. Finally, they also released their music to Spotify in June 2015, though they previously refused to do so.
AC/DC was formed in 1973 by brothers Angus and Malcolm Young, and released two albums in Australia before releasing their first international effort, High Voltage with vocalist Bon Scott, bassist Mark Evans and drummer Phil Rudd. In 1980, Bon Scott died less than a year after the release of the successful Highway to Hell, and was replaced by British singer Brian Johnson, with whom AC/DC released their best selling album, Back in Black. Their latest album to date, Rock Or Bust, was released in 2013, selling 2.8 million copies in 2014. In 39 years of their career, AC/DC sold over 200 million albums worldwide, roughly 71 million in the US. Back in Black alone sold 22 million (50 million worldwide), and is the second highest-selling album of all time.

Nänie (the German form of Latin nenia, meaning "a funeral song") is a composition for SATB chorus and orchestra, Op. 82 by Johannes Brahms, which sets to music the poem Nänie by Friedrich Schiller. Brahms composed the piece in 1881, in memory of his deceased friend Anselm Feuerbach. Nänie is a lamentation on the inevitability of death; the first sentence, Auch das Schöne muß sterben, translates to "Even the Beautiful must die." An average performance has a duration of approximately 15 minutes.
The text follows:

Auch das Schöne muß sterben! Das Menschen und Götter bezwinget,
Nicht die eherne Brust rührt es dem stygischen Zeus.
Einmal nur erweichte die Liebe den Schattenbeherrscher,
Und an der Schwelle noch, streng, rief er zurück sein Geschenk.
Nicht stillt Aphrodite dem schönen Knaben die Wunde,
Die in den zierlichen Leib grausam der Eber geritzt.
Nicht errettet den göttlichen Held die unsterbliche Mutter,
Wann er am skäischen Tor fallend sein Schicksal erfüllt.
Aber sie steigt aus dem Meer mit allen Töchtern des Nereus,
Und die Klage hebt an um den verherrlichten Sohn.
Siehe! Da weinen die Götter, es weinen die Göttinnen alle,
Daß das Schöne vergeht, daß das Vollkommene stirbt.
Auch ein Klaglied zu sein im Mund der Geliebten ist herrlich;
Denn das Gemeine geht klanglos zum Orkus hinab.
English translation:
Even the beautiful must perish! That which overcomes gods and men
Moves not the armored heart of the Stygian Zeus.
Only once did love come to soften the Lord of the Shadows,
And just at the threshold he sternly took back his gift.
Neither can Aphrodite heal the wounds of the beautiful youth
That the boar had savagely torn in his delicate body.
Nor can the deathless mother rescue the divine hero
When, at the Scaean gate now falling, he fulfills his fate.
But she ascends from the sea with all the daughters of Nereus,
And she raises a plaint here for her glorious son.
Behold! The gods weep, all the goddesses weep,
That the beautiful perishes, that the most perfect passes away.
But a lament on the lips of loved ones is glorious,
For the ignoble goes down to Orcus in silence.
A setting of the text by Hermann Goetz, written in 1874, is also extant and has been recorded.

Bowman v. Monsanto Co., 569 U.S. ___ (2013) was a United States Supreme Court patent decision in which the Court unanimously affirmed the decision of the Federal Circuit that the patent exhaustion doctrine does not permit a farmer to plant and grow saved, patented seeds without the patent owner's permission. The case arose after Vernon Hugh Bowman, an Indiana farmer, bought transgenic soybean seeds from a local grain elevator for his second crop of the season. Monsanto originally sold the soybeans to farmers under a limited use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer from using the seeds for more than a single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting. The farmers sold their soybean crops (also seeds) to the local grain elevator, from which Bowman then bought them. After Bowman replanted seeds for his second harvest, Monsanto filed a lawsuit claiming that he infringed on their patents by replanting soybeans without a license. In response, Bowman argued that Monsanto's claims were barred under the doctrine of patent exhaustion, because all future generations of soybeans were embodied in the first generation that was originally sold.
In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan, the Supreme Court ruled that Bowman's conduct infringed upon Monsanto's patent rights and that the doctrine of patent exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patented seeds through planting and harvesting without the patent holder's permission. The Court held that, when a farmer plants a harvested and saved seed, thereby growing another soybean crop, that action constitutes an unauthorized "making" of the patented product.
The case garnered attention in part due to its potential impact on policy about genetically modified crops and self-replicating technologies, and due to the involvement of Justice Clarence Thomas, who previously served as a lawyer for Monsanto. Commentators noted, however, that the Court's ruling was narrow in scope, and did not set a broad legal precedent with respect to the applicability of the doctrine of patent exhaustion to self-replicating technologies.

; born March 5, 1970) is an American guitarist, singer, producer and composer. He is best known as the former guitarist of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, from 1988 until 1992, and again from 1998 until 2009. He recorded five studio albums with them.
Frusciante has an active solo career, having released eleven solo albums and five EPs; his recordings include elements ranging from experimental rock and ambient music to new wave and electronica. In 2015, Frusciante released his debut acid house album under his alias, Trickfinger. He has also recorded with numerous other artists, including The Mars Volta, for whom he was a studio guitarist (and occasional live performer) from 2002 until 2008; Josh Klinghoffer and Joe Lally, with whom he released two albums as Ataxia; and various collaborations with both Klinghoffer and Omar Rodríguez-López.  He has also produced and/or recorded with Duran Duran, Wu-Tang Clan, The Mars Volta and Omar Rodriguez Lopez, Swahili Blonde, Black Knights, The Bicycle Thief, Glenn Hughes, Ziggy Marley, Johnny Cash, George Clinton, and others.
At the age of eighteen, he joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers, first appearing on the band's 1989 album, Mother's Milk. The group's follow-up album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), was a breakthrough success. Frusciante became overwhelmed by the band's new popularity and quit in 1992. He became a recluse and entered a long period of drug addiction, during which he released his first solo recordings: Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt (1994) and Smile from the Streets You Hold (1997). In 1998, he successfully completed drug rehabilitation and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Their next album, Californication (1999) would eventually go on to sell 16 million copies. His album To Record Only Water for Ten Days was made in 2001. A fourth album with the Chili Peppers, By the Way was released in 2002. On a creative spree, Frusciante released six solo albums in 2004; each album explored different recording techniques and genres. 2006 saw the release of his fifth and final album with the Chili Peppers, Stadium Arcadium. In 2009, Frusciante released The Empyrean, which features Flea and Josh Klinghoffer, and announced he had again parted ways with the Chili Peppers.

Frusciante has received critical recognition for his guitar playing, ranking at number 18 on Rolling Stone's list of "The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" in 2003; and again in a second list published in 2011, where he ranked at number 72. He was ranked as number 42 in Gibson's list of the "50 Best Guitarists of All Time". He was voted "The Best Guitarist of the Last 30 Years" in a 2010 BBC poll called "The Axe Factor". Frusciante was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on April 14, 2012 although he did not attend the ceremony.

It is one of the first social studies of entertainment and the leisure industry from a political-ideological angle, and the book deals extensively with the political role of children's literature.

Intergraph Standard File Formats (ISFF) are the file formats common to MicroStation and Intergraph's Interactive Graphics Design System (IGDS). ISFF is made available to the public, so that third-party developers could create applications for MicroStation that read and write ISFF format without a license from Intergraph.

Design files, or DGN files (*.dgn) are binary files with variable-length records for graphic elements, and non-graphic data.  
Cell library files (*.cel) are binary files that store cell definitions for placement in design files.MicroStation versions 8 and newer support the V8 DGN file format, but which has a different internal data structure than the ISFF-based DGN.  In cases where there is potential for confusion, ISFF-based DGN may be called Intergraph DGN, or V7 DGN.
Autodesk has chosen not to support DGN in AutoCAD 2006, although it does support the format in its Map3D, Land Desktop, and Civil3D products.

Hiroya Hatsushiba (Japanese: 初芝 弘也, Hatsushiba Hiroya) is the founder of video game developer tri-Crescendo, and a long time sound programmer  for composer Motoi Sakuraba, whom he also gives English titles of the tracks Sakuraba creates.
Hatsushiba came up as a sound director and programmer for the Telenet Japan subsidiary Wolfteam in 1993. It is here that he met Sakuraba; these two have worked together on various games since then. He was one of the many people that left Telenet Japan on March 6, 1995 to participate in the founding of tri-Ace. Here, he continued his sound programmer duties for Sakuraba, as well as doing some field programming. 
In 1999, he left tri-Ace and formed tri-Crescendo. While initially continuing to provide sound programming for tri-Ace's games, tri-Crescendo moved into game development in 2001. Hatsushiba partnered up with Monolith Soft to develop Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean, which became one of the more successful games for GameCube. Developmental duties have continued for its sequel, as well as the recent Eternal Sonata, which he both directed and wrote story material for, as writing the original lyrics (later adapted into Italian) for the original song "Heaven's Mirror."

His alias "Hassy" has been said to be fellow game sound designer Michiko Naruke's. However, Michiko claimed in an interview "Hassy" was not her, but rather Hatsushiba.

The GeForce 800M Series is a family of graphics processing units by Nvidia for laptop PCs. It consists of rebrands of mobile versions of the GeForce 700 series and some newer chips that are lower end compared to the rebrands.
The GeForce 800 series name was originally planned to be used for both desktop and mobile chips based on the Maxwell microarchitecture (GM-codenamed chips), named after the Scottish theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell, which was previously introduced into the GeForce 700 series in the GTX 750 and GTX 750 Ti, released on February 18, 2014. However, because mobile GPUs under the GeForce 800M series have already been released using the Kepler architecture, Nvidia decided to rename its GeForce 800 series desktop GPUs as the GeForce 900 series.The Maxwell microarchitecture, the successor to Kepler microarchitecture, will for the first time feature an integrated ARM CPU of its own. This will make Maxwell GPUs more independent from the main CPU according to Nvidia's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang. Nvidia expects three major things from the Maxwell architecture: improved graphics capabilities, simplified programming as well as better energy-efficiency compared to the GeForce 700 Series and GeForce 600 Series 
Maxwell was announced in September 2010. The first GeForce consumer-class products based on the Maxwell architecture were released in early 2014. Nvidia is expected to release the Maxwell-powered Tesla accelerator cards as well as Quadro professional graphics cards based on this architecture in late 2014. Eventually, Maxwell architecture will be used for mobile application processors that belong to the Erista family of Tegra SoCs.

Ernst Heinrich Hoffmann (June 18, 1899–January 3, 1956) was an American conductor who served as the music director of the Houston Symphony for eleven years.
Hoffmann was born in Boston, Massachusetts.  His father was a violinist in the Boston Symphony Orchestra.  Although Ernst was an accomplished musician in his youth, during which he studied piano with the noted Harold Bauer, he enrolled in the anthropology program at Harvard University.  Hoffmann was graduated cum laude in that discipline, whereupon he was offered a position on the Harvard anthropology faculty.  He chose instead to go to Germany in 1920 to study music at the conservatory in Berlin.  During this time he met Annemarie Clara ("Mini") Hoffmann (her maiden name), a native German teacher of mathematics and languages, whom he married in 1922, and with whom he had one child, a son, Clifford (born in 1927).
Following his Berlin studies, Hoffmann performed as a violinist in Berlin theatre orchestras, often under the baton of the eminent Richard Strauss.  In 1924 he was appointed conductor-in-chief of the Breslau Opera and Philharmonic, a position he held for ten years until, under the advent of Hitler's regime, he was declared unacceptable for the position because of his American citizenship.
Hoffmann returned to the United States in 1934.  In Boston, he founded the Commonwealth Symphony Orchestra and became its music director.  There he came to the attention of leaders of the Houston Symphony, and he was engaged as that orchestra's music director in 1936.  Hoffmann was a popular figure in Houston, and his tenure on the podium there was the longest of any music director to that point.
In 1947 Hoffmann left Houston and soon afterward accepted a position as director of orchestral music at Indiana University, a position he held until his death.

En route to Indiana following a Christmas 1955 visit to their son in Houston, Ernst and Annemarie Hoffmann died in an automobile accident near Clarksdale, Mississippi, on January 3, 1956.

The 1966 Soviet submarine global circumnavigation was announced to be the first submerged around-the-world voyage by a group of Soviet nuclear-powered submarines.The voyage was an early example of blue-water operations by the Soviet Navy's nuclear-powered submarine fleet, and it paved the way for future operations during the latter half of the Cold War.  The voyage took place nearly six years after the first complete submerged circumnavigation of the world undertaken by the U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered submarine Triton in 1960.

Technically speaking, this Soviet submerged around-the-world voyage was not a true "circumnavigation" since the submarine group went from the Soviet Northern Fleet in the area of the Kola Peninsula to the Soviet Pacific Fleet base in Kamchatka going around South America and consequently did not go completely around the world as did the USS Triton.

The Million Family March was a rally in Washington D.C to celebrate family unity and racial and religious harmony; as well as to address other issues, including abortion, capital punishment, health care, education, welfare and Social Security reform, substance abuse prevention, and overhaul of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The march’s organizers also planned a voter registration drive and hoped that participants would be encouraged to vote in the upcoming presidential and congressional elections. Louis Farrakhan was the main speaker and the event was sponsored by his organization, The Nation of Islam, and by Sun Myung Moon's Family Federation for World Peace and Unification (usually known as the Unification Church). It was held on October 16, 2000; the fifth anniversary of the Million Man March, which was also organized by Minister Farrakhan.Benjamin Chavis Muhammad, the national director for the march, when asked by USA Today if he thought  it would be as successful as the Million Man March answered: "Yes, we believe that the Million Family March will be as successful as the Million Man March. But the Million Man March and the Million Family March have different objectives. One builds on the other. The Million Family March is an expansion of the Million Man March."Minister Farrakhan told Nation of Islam members: "I don't want us to get bent out of shape because folk of another race desire to help. I say to the Muslims that are present that I am grateful for the help of the Family Federation for World Peace under Rev. and Mrs. Moon ... The Honorable Elijah Muhammad told us that people would come from the East, that they would teach us everything we need to know in order to be the people that God meant for us to be."Dan Fefferman, a leader in the Unification Church of the United States, wrote a letter to fellow church members saying that Rev. Moon knew that some of them had "problems with Minister Farrakhan", including the Nation of Islam's push for "a ban on interracial marriage and their support for a separate nation for American blacks ... There are certainly policies in the march's agenda ... which most of us do not support ... our support for the march is limited to central themes such as the God-centered family, interracial harmony, interreligous unity and moral revival."
In his speech Minister Farrakhan called for racial harmony.

The violin may have been introduced to India by the military bandsmen of the East India Company around 1790. Baluswami Dikshitar, brother of renowned Carnatic Composer Muthuswami Dikshitar, learned the instrument from the military  bandmaster in Madras and adapted his playing style to suit Carnatic Music. There are two styles of violin playing in India: the Carnatic and the Hindustani. Carnatic violinists such as Tirukkodikaval Krishna Iyer, Malaikkottai Govindaswamy Pillai and Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu performed concerts as early as the 1900. Indian violinists today such as Balabhaskar, L. Shankar have successfully adapted the Western music style of playing the violin and have been performing concerts outside of India. Violinists such as N. Rajam and Sangeeta Shankar are highly accomplished international performers in the Hindustani style. Violinists such as T.N. Krishnan, H.K. Venkatram and Mysore brothers have remained Carnatic classical violinists and have yet been able to reach out to audiences outside of India. Also, artists such as Jyotsna Srikanth, L. Subramaniam, Ambi Subramaniam have satisfactorily managed to perform both Carnatic and Western music on the violin. The following is a list of famous Indian violinists.

The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others) and powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed.
The term "cold" is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two sides, although there were major regional wars, known as proxy wars, supported by the two sides. The Cold War split the temporary wartime alliance against Nazi Germany, leaving the Soviet Union and the United States as two superpowers with profound economic and political differences. The USSR was a  Marxist–Leninist state ruled by its Communist Party and secret police, who in turn were ruled by a dictator (Stalin) or a small committee ("Politburo"). The Party controlled the press, the military, the economy and all organizations. It also controlled the other states in the Eastern bloc, and funded Communist parties around the world, sometimes in competition with Communist China, particularly following the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s. In opposition stood the West, dominantly democratic and capitalist with a free press and independent organizations.  A small neutral bloc arose with the Non-Aligned Movement; it sought good relations with both sides.  The two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat, but they were heavily armed in preparation for a possible all-out nuclear world war. Each side had a nuclear deterrent that deterred an attack by the other side, on the basis that such an attack would lead to total destruction of the attacker: the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). Aside from the development of the two sides' nuclear arsenals, and deployment of conventional military forces, the struggle for dominance was expressed via proxy wars around the globe, psychological warfare, massive propaganda campaigns and espionage, rivalry at sports events, and technological competitions such as the Space Race.
The first phase of the Cold War began in the first two years after the end of the Second World War in 1945. The USSR consolidated its control over the states of the Eastern Bloc, while the United States began a strategy of global containment to challenge Soviet power, extending military and financial aid to the countries of Western Europe (for example, supporting the anti-communist side in the Greek Civil War) and creating the NATO alliance. The Berlin Blockade (1948–49) was the first major crisis of the Cold War. With the victory of the communist side in the Chinese Civil War and the outbreak of the Korean War (1950–53), the conflict expanded. The USSR and USA competed for influence in Latin America, and the decolonizing states of Africa and Asia. Meanwhile, the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was stopped by the Soviets. The expansion and escalation sparked more crises, such as the Suez Crisis (1956), the Berlin Crisis of 1961, and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, a new phase began that saw the Sino-Soviet split complicate relations within the communist sphere, while US allies, particularly France, demonstrated greater independence of action. The USSR crushed the 1968 Prague Spring liberalization program in Czechoslovakia, and the Vietnam War (1955–75) ended with a defeat of the US-backed Republic of South Vietnam, prompting further adjustments.
By the 1970s, both sides had become interested in accommodations to create a more stable and predictable international system, inaugurating a period of détente that saw Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the US opening relations with the People's Republic of China as a strategic counterweight to the Soviet Union. Détente collapsed at the end of the decade with the Soviet war in Afghanistan beginning in 1979. The early 1980s were another period of elevated tension, with the Soviet downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 (1983), and the "Able Archer" NATO military exercises (1983). The United States increased diplomatic, military, and economic pressures on the Soviet Union, at a time when the communist state was already suffering from economic stagnation. In the mid-1980s, the new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the liberalizing reforms of perestroika ("reorganization", 1987) and glasnost ("openness", c. 1985) and ended Soviet involvement in Afghanistan. Pressures for national independence grew stronger in Eastern Europe, especially Poland. Gorbachev meanwhile refused to use Soviet troops to bolster the faltering Warsaw Pact regimes as had occurred in the past. The result in 1989 was a wave of revolutions that peacefully (with the exception of the Romanian Revolution) overthrew all of the communist regimes of Central and Eastern Europe. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union itself lost control and was banned following an abortive coup attempt in August 1991. This in turn led to the formal dissolution of the USSR in December 1991 and the collapse of communist regimes in other countries such as Mongolia, Cambodia and South Yemen. The United States remained as the world's only superpower.

The Cold War and its events have left a significant legacy. It is often referred to in popular culture, especially in media featuring themes of espionage (e.g. the internationally successful James Bond movie franchise) and the threat of nuclear warfare.

In computer science, a family of hash functions is said to be <math>k</math>-independent or <math>k</math>-universal if selecting a  function at random from the family guarantees that the hash codes of any designated <math>k</math> keys are independent random variables (see precise mathematical definitions below). Such families allow good average case performance in randomized algorithms or data structures, even if the input data is chosen by an adversary. The trade-offs between the degree of independence and the efficiency of evaluating the hash function are well studied, and many <math>k</math>-independent families have been proposed.

Eddard "Ned" Stark is a fictional character in the first book of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels and the first season of its television adaptation. Introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones, Ned is the honorable lord of Winterfell, an ancient fortress in the North of the fictional continent of Westeros. Though the character is established as a primary character in the novel and the TV adaptation, Martin's plot twist at the end involving Ned shocked both readers of the book and viewers of the TV series.
Ned is portrayed by Sean Bean in the first season of HBO's adaptation of the series, Game of Thrones, and as a child and young man by Sebastian Croft and Robert Aramayo respectively in the sixth season. Bean was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actor on Television and a Scream Award for Best Fantasy Actor for the role. He and the rest of the cast were nominated for Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2011.

The Proggy programming fonts are a set of free fixed-width typefaces designed with programming and terminal work in mind.
The project started with the four Proggy typefaces authored by Tristan Grimmer: Proggy Clean, Square, Small, and Tiny, circa 2004. Other contributors had their fonts added to the collection with time, which account to about 10 additional typefaces.
It was mentioned by Jeff Atwood. The Proggy collection became very popular among programmers and system administrators. It is currently a member of the Gentoo Linux packaging system.

The typefaces are usually provided as single-size 9 point raster fonts. They are offered in a variety of formats in order to be usable on different platforms, including Windows, Mac OS X, Unix and Unix-like systems.

Louis Riel is an opera in three acts by the Canadian composer Harry Somers.
This full-length opera was written for the 1967 Canadian centennial. It concerns the controversial Métis leader Louis Riel, who was executed in 1885, and is one of Somers' biggest pieces.
It is arguably the most famous Canadian opera. Somers set the music to an English and French libretto by Mavor Moore and Jacques Languirand. The opera was commissioned by the Floyd S. Chalmers Foundation and produced by the Canadian Opera Company with financial assistance from the Canadian Centennial Commission, the Canada Council, and the Province of Ontario Council for the Arts (Ontario Arts Council).

Binary or binomial classification is the task of classifying the elements of a given set into two groups on the basis of a classification rule. Instancing a decision whether an item has or not some qualitative property, some specified characteristic, some typical binary classification tasks are:

 Medical testing to determine if a patient has certain disease or not – the classification property is the presence of the disease.
 A "pass or fail" test method or quality control in factories, i.e. deciding if a specification has or has not been met – a Go/no go classification.
 Information retrieval, namely deciding whether a page or an article should be in the result set of a search or not – the classification property is the relevance of the article, or the usefulness to the user.Binary classification is dichotomization applied to practical purposes, and therefore an important point is that in many practical binary classification problems, the two groups are not symmetric – rather than overall accuracy, the relative proportion of different types of errors is of interest. For example, in medical testing, a false positive (detecting a disease when it is not present) is considered differently from a false negative (not detecting a disease when it is present).
Porting human discriminative abilities to scientific soundness and technical practice is far from trivial.

Erdoğanism refers to the political ideals and agenda of Turkish President and former Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who became Prime Minister in 2003 and served until his election to the Presidency in 2014. With support significantly derived from charismatic authority, Erdoğanism has been described as the "strongest phenomenon in Turkey since Kemalism" and enjoys broad support throughout the country. Its ideological roots originate from Turkish conservatism and its most predominant political adherent is the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP), a party that Erdoğan founded in 2001.
As a personified version of conservative democracy, key ideals of Erdoğanism include a religious inspired strong centralised leadership based primarily on electoral consent and less so on the separation of powers and institutional checks and balances. Critics have often referred to Erdoğan's political outlook as authoritarian and as an elective dictatorship. The election-centric outlook of Erdoğanism has often been described as an illiberal democracy by foreign leaders, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Erdoğanism is also strongly influenced by the desire to establish a 'New Turkey', departing from the founding Kemalist principles of the Turkish Republic and abolishing key enshrined constitutional ideals that are at odds with Erdoğan's vision, such as secularism. Supporters of Erdoğanism often call for a revival of cultural and traditional values from the Ottoman Empire and are critical of the pro-western social reforms and modernisation initiated by the founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Grassroots support for Erdoğanism mainly originates from the development of a cult of personality around Erdoğan, as well as the predominance of charismatic authority.

In ring theory and homological algebra, the global dimension (or global homological dimension; sometimes just called homological dimension) of a ring A denoted gl dim A, is a non-negative integer or infinity which is a homological invariant of the ring. It is defined to be the supremum of the set of projective dimensions of all A-modules. Global dimension is an important technical notion in the dimension theory of Noetherian rings. By a theorem of Jean-Pierre Serre, global dimension can be used to characterize within the class of commutative Noetherian local rings those rings which are regular. Their global dimension coincides with the Krull dimension, whose definition is module-theoretic.
When the ring A is noncommutative, one initially has to consider two versions of this notion, right global dimension that arises from consideration of the right A-modules, and left global dimension that arises from consideration of the left A-modules. For an arbitrary ring A the right and left global dimensions may differ. However, if A is a Noetherian ring, both of these dimensions turn out to be equal to weak global dimension, whose definition is left-right symmetric. Therefore, for noncommutative Noetherian rings, these two versions coincide and one is justified in talking about the global dimension.

Anglican church music is music that is written for liturgical worship in Anglican church services.
Almost all of it is written for choir with or without organ accompaniment. The choir typically uses "SATB" voices (soprano or treble, alto or counter-tenor, tenor, and bass), though in many works some or all of these voices are divided into two for part or all of the piece; in this case the two halves of the choir (one on each side of the aisle) are traditionally named decani (or 1, for the higher voice) and cantoris (or 2, for the lower voice). There may also be soloists, usually only for part of the piece. There are also works for fewer voices, such as those written for solely men's voices or boys'/women's voices.
Many more recent works were written for, or dedicated to, one of the many famous cathedral or collegiate choirs of England. 
The chief musical forms are:

 Preces and responses — sung antiphonally by the priest (or a lay cantor) and choir
 Psalms — sung to Anglican chant by the choir or congregation
 Service settings — choral settings of the ordinary of the Eucharist, and canticles
 Anthems or motets
 Hymns, usually for congregational useIn all but the smallest churches the congregation was until recently confined to the singing of hymns. Over the past half century or so efforts have been made to increase the role of the congregation and also to introduce more "popular" musical styles in the evangelical and charismatic leaning congregations. Not all churches can boast a full SATB choir, and a repertoire of one-, two- and three-part music is more suitable for many parish church choirs, a fact which is recognised in the current work of the Royal School of Church Music.
Anglican churches also frequently draw upon the musical traditions of other Christian  denominations. Works by Catholic composers such as Mozart, Lutherans such as Bach, Calvinists like Mendelssohn, and composers from other branches of Christianity are often featured. This is particularly the case in music for the Mass in Anglo-Catholic churches, much of which is taken from the work of Roman Catholic composers.

The probabilistic voting theory, also known as the probabilistic voting model, is a voting theory developed by professors Assar Lindbeck and Jörgen Weibull in the article "Balanced-budget redistribution as the outcome of political competition", published in 1987 in the journal Public Choice, which has gradually replaced the median voter theory, thanks to its ability to find equilibrium within multi-dimensional spaces.
The probabilistic voting model assumes that voters are imperfectly informed about candidates and their platforms. Candidates are also imperfectly informed about the utility preferences of the electorate and the distribution of voters' preferences.
Unlike the median voter theorem, what drives the equilibrium policy is both the numerosity and the density of social groups and not the median position of voters on a preference scale. This difference explains why social groups which have a great homogeneity of preferences are more politically powerful than those whose preferences are dispersed.

It was written in late 1917 and became a modest hit, recorded by Billy Murray for both Victor Records and Edison Records.   The song may have been featured in some versions of the 1917 Broadway play Going Up.

In econometrics and signal processing, a stochastic process is said to be ergodic if its statistical properties can be deduced from a single, sufficiently long, random sample  of the process. The reasoning is that any collection of random samples from a process must represent the average statistical properties of the entire process. In other words, regardless of what the individual samples are, a birds-eye view of the collection of samples must represent the whole process. Conversely, a process that is not ergodic is a process that changes erratically at an inconsistent rate.

Eega (English: The Fly) is a 2012 Indian bilingual fantasy film written by K. V. Vijayendra Prasad and directed by his son, S. S. Rajamouli. It was produced by Korrapati Ranganatha Sai's Varahi Chalana Chitram with an estimated budget of ₹260 to 400 million, and was made simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil, the latter as Naan Ee (I, Housefly). The film stars Sudeep, Nani, and Samantha Ruth Prabhu. M. M. Keeravani composed the soundtrack and score. K. K. Senthil Kumar was director of photography and Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao edited the film. Janardhan Maharshi and Crazy Mohan wrote the dialogue for the Telugu and Tamil versions, respectively.
The narrative of Eega is in the form of a bedtime story told by a father to his daughter. Its protagonist is Nani, who is in love with his neighbour Bindu. Nani is murdered by a wealthy businessman named Sudeep, who is attracted to Bindu and considers Nani a rival. Nani reincarnates as a housefly and tries to protect Bindu while avenging his death.
The idea for the film originated in the 1990s from a conversation in which Prasad joked with Rajamouli about the idea of a fly seeking revenge against a human. Rajamouli reconsidered the idea after finishing Maryada Ramanna (2010), and Prasad developed it into a script. The film's production began on 7 December 2010 at Ramanaidu Studios in Hyderabad. Principal photography began on 22 February 2011 and continued until late February 2012. Makuta VFX and Annapurna Studios oversaw Eega's visual effects and digital intermediate process, respectively.
The two versions of the film, alongside a Malayalam-dubbed version titled Eecha, were released on 6 July 2012 in approximately 1,100 screens globally. The performances of the principal cast, Rajamouli's direction, and visual effects received critical acclaim upon release. Eega was one of the highest-grossing Telugu film of the year, earning more than ₹1.25 billion. Its Hindi-dubbed version, Makkhi, which was released on 12 October 2012, was not as commercially successful as the others. Eega won two National Film Awards (Best Feature Film in Telugu and Best Special Effects), five Filmfare Awards, and three South Indian International Movie Awards. It was screened at the eighth annual Toronto After Dark Film Festival, the 16th Shanghai International Film Festival, and the 2013 Madrid International Film Festival.

Its counterpart for drivers in Northern Ireland is the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA). The agency issues driving licences, organises collection of vehicle excise duty (also known as road tax and road fund licence) and sells personalised registrations.
The DVLA is an executive agency of the Department for Transport (DfT). The current Chief Executive of the agency is Oliver Morley.The DVLA is based in Swansea, Wales, with a prominent 16-storey building in Clase and offices in Swansea Vale. It was previously known as the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre (DVLC). The agency previously had a network of 39 offices around Great Britain, known as the Local Office Network, where users could attend to apply for licences and transact other business, but in the early 21st century the local offices were completely closed by December 2013. The agency's work is consequently fully centralised in Swansea, with the majority of users having to transact remotely - by post or (for some transactions) by phone or online.
DVLA introduced Electronic Vehicle Licensing (EVL) in 2004, allowing customers to pay vehicle excise duty online and by telephone. However, customers still have the option to tax their vehicles via the Post Office. A seven-year contract enabling the Post Office to continue to process car tax applications was agreed in November 2012, with the option of a three-year extension.

Oliver Wolf Sacks, CBE, FRCP (9 July 1933 – 30 August 2015) was a British neurologist, naturalist and author who spent his professional life in the United States. He believed that the brain is the "most incredible thing in the universe" and therefore important to study. He became widely known for writing best-selling case histories about his patients' disorders, with some of his books adapted for stage and film.After Sacks received his medical degree from the Queen's College, Oxford in 1960, he interned at Middlesex Hospital (part of University College, London) before moving to the U.S. He then interned at Mount Zion Hospital in San Francisco and completed his residency in neurology and neuropathology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He relocated to New York in 1965, where he first worked under a paid fellowship in neurochemistry and neuropathology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Upon realising that the neuro-research career he envisioned for himself would be a poor fit, in 1966 he began serving as neurologist at Beth Abraham Hospital's chronic-care facility in the Bronx. While there, he worked with a group of survivors of the 1920s sleeping sickness encephalitis lethargica, who had been unable to move on their own for decades.  His treatment of those patients became the basis of his book Awakenings.  In the period from 1966 to 1991 he was a neurological consultant to various New York City nursing homes, hospitals, and at the Bronx Psychiatric Center.
Sacks was the author of numerous best-selling books, mostly collections of case studies of people with neurological disorders. His writings have been featured in a wide range of media; the New York Times called him a "poet laureate of contemporary medicine", and "one of the great clinical writers of the 20th century".  His books include a wealth of narrative detail about his experiences with patients, and how they coped with their conditions, often illuminating how the normal brain deals with perception, memory and individuality.

Awakenings (1973) was adapted into an Academy Award-nominated film in 1990, starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. He and his book Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain were the subject of "Musical Minds", an episode of the PBS series Nova. Sacks was awarded a CBE for services to literature in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 2008.

The Bells of St. Mary's has come to be commonly associated with the Christmas season, due most likely to the inclusion of a scene involving a Christmas pageant at the school, and the fact that the film was released in December 1945.

Jozéf Turczyński (1884 – 1953) was a Polish pianist, pedagogue and musicologist who exercised a powerful influence over the development of piano teaching and performance, especially in the works of Frédéric Chopin, during the first half of the 20th century. He was in a large part responsible for a performing edition of the Complete Pianoforte Works of Chopin which is still considered definitive.
Turczyński was born in Żytomierz, in a part of Volhynia which is now in the Ukraine. He was first a pupil of his father. In 1907-1908 he studied with Ferruccio Busoni in Vienna, and made his debut in 1908. He then made further studies with Anna Yesipova in Russia, and took first prize at the piano competition in St Petersburg in 1911. He played in all the European capitals, and from 1915 to 1919 was a professor at the Kiev Conservatory. Then he returned to Poland to take over the concert-pianists' class at the Warsaw State Conservatory.
Among the pianists who received instruction from him were Halina Czerny-Stefańska (1935–39), Witold Małcużyński, Henryk Sztompka, Stanisław Szpinalski and Ryszard Bakst. See: List of music students by teacher: T to Z#Józef Turczyński.
The Edition of the Complete Works of Chopin, the most widely accepted edition since the Second World War, was begun under the editorial chairmanship of Ignacy Jan Paderewski in 1937. It was prepared for the Frederic Chopin Institute in Warsaw (Instytut Fryderyka Chopina, Polskie Wydawnictwo Muzyczne). On Paderewski's death in 1941, when it was only just begun, Turczyński took on the task with Ludwik Bronarski, and brought the work to completion in 1949 in 27 volumes. Each volume carries a bar-by-bar commentary upon variant texts as a supplement, and the edition was based primarily on comparison of autograph manuscripts, approved copies and first editions, with special attention to original dynamic markings and fingerings, etc.
In his later years Turczyński lived in Brazil, but he died in Lausanne, Switzerland.

Borůvka's algorithm is an algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in a graph for which all edge weights are distinct.
It was first published in 1926 by Otakar Borůvka as a method of constructing an efficient electricity network for Moravia.
The algorithm was rediscovered by Choquet in 1938; again by Florek,  Łukasiewicz, Perkal, Steinhaus, and Zubrzycki in 1951; and again by Sollin
 in 1965. Because Sollin was the only computer scientist in this list living in an English speaking country, this algorithm is frequently called Sollin's algorithm, especially in the parallel computing literature.

The algorithm begins by first examining each vertex and adding the cheapest edge from that vertex to another in the graph, without regard to already added edges, and continues joining these groupings in a like manner until a tree spanning all vertices is completed.

An orchestra hit, also known as an orchestral hit, orchestra stab, or orchestral stab, is a sound effect created through the layering of the sounds of a number of different synthesized orchestral instruments playing a single staccato note or chord. The orchestra hit sound was propagated by the use of early samplers, particularly the Fairlight CMI where it was known as the ORCH5 sample.  The sound is used in pop, hip hop and techno genres to accentuate passages of music.
The orchestra hit has been identified as a "hip hop cliché". In 1990, Musician magazine stated that Fairlight's ORCH5 sample was "the orchestral hit that was heard on every rap and techno-pop record of the early 1980s".  The orchestra hit has been described as popular music's equivalent to the Wilhelm scream.

Follies is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by James Goldman.  The story concerns a reunion in a crumbling Broadway theatre, scheduled for demolition, of the past performers of the "Weismann's Follies", a musical revue (based on the Ziegfeld Follies), that played in that theatre between the world wars.  It focuses on two couples, Buddy and Sally Durant Plummer and Benjamin and Phyllis Rogers Stone, who are attending the reunion. Sally and Phyllis were showgirls in the Follies. Both couples are deeply unhappy with their marriages.  Buddy, a traveling salesman, is having an affair with a girl on the road; Sally is still as much in love with Ben as she was years ago; and Ben is so self-absorbed that Phyllis feels emotionally abandoned.  Several of the former showgirls perform their old numbers, sometimes accompanied by the ghosts of their former selves.
The Broadway production opened on April 4, 1971, directed by Harold Prince and Michael Bennett, and with choreography by Bennett.  The musical was nominated for eleven Tony Awards and won seven.  The original production, which ultimately lost its entire investment, ran for 522 performances.  The piece has enjoyed a number of major revivals, and several of its songs have become standards, including "Broadway Baby", "I'm Still Here", "Too Many Mornings", "Could I Leave You?", and "Losing My Mind".

A pentomino is a plane geometric figure formed by joining five equal squares edge to edge.  It is a polyomino with five cells.  There are twelve pentominoes, not counting rotations and reflections as distinct.  They are used chiefly in recreational mathematics for puzzles and problems.Ordinarily, the pentomino obtained by reflecting or rotating a pentomino does not count as a different pentomino.  The F, L, N, P, Y, and Z pentominoes are chiral; adding their reflections (F', J, N', Q, Y', S) brings the number of one-sided pentominoes to 18. Pentominoes I, T, U, V, W, and X, remain the same when reflected.  This matters in some video games in which the pieces may not be reflected, such as Tetris imitations and Rampart.

Each of the twelve pentominoes satisfies the Conway criterion; hence every pentomino is capable of tiling the plane.  Each chiral pentomino can tile the plane without reflecting it.

Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-relational mapping, although some programmers opt to construct their own ORM tools.
In object-oriented programming,  data-management tasks act on object-oriented (OO) objects that are almost always non-scalar values. For example, consider an address book entry that represents a single person along with zero or more phone numbers and zero or more addresses. This could be modeled in an object-oriented implementation by a "Person object" with attributes/fields to hold each data item that the entry comprises: the person's name, a list of phone numbers, and a list of addresses. The list of phone numbers would itself contain "PhoneNumber objects" and so on. The address-book entry is treated as a single object by the programming language (it can be referenced by a single variable containing a pointer to the object, for instance). Various methods can be associated with the object, such as a method to return the preferred phone number, the home address, and so on.
However, many popular database products such as SQL database management systems (DBMS) can only store and manipulate scalar values such as integers and strings organized within tables. The programmer must either convert the object values into groups of simpler values for storage in the database (and convert them back upon retrieval), or only use simple scalar values within the program. Object-relational mapping implements the first approach.
The heart of the problem involves translating the logical representation of the objects into an atomized form that is capable of being stored in the database, while preserving the properties of the objects and their relationships so that they can be reloaded as objects when needed. If this storage and retrieval functionality is implemented, the objects are said to be persistent.

The friendship paradox is the phenomenon first observed by the sociologist Scott L. Feld in 1991 that most people have fewer friends than their friends have, on average. It can be explained as a form of sampling bias in which people with greater numbers of friends have an increased likelihood of being observed among one's own friends. In contradiction to this, most people believe that they have more friends than their friends have.
The same observation can be applied more generally to social networks defined by other relations than friendship: for instance, most people's sexual partners have had (on the average) a greater number of sexual partners than they have.

Stretched tuning is a detail of musical tuning, applied to wire-stringed musical instruments, older, non-digital electric pianos (such as the Fender Rhodes piano and Wurlitzer electric piano), and some sample-based synthesizers based on these instruments, to accommodate the natural inharmonicity of their vibrating elements. In stretched tuning, two notes an octave apart, whose fundamental frequencies theoretically have an exact 2:1 ratio, are tuned slightly farther apart (a stretched octave). "For a stretched tuning the octave is greater than a factor of 2; for a compressed tuning the octave is smaller than a factor of 2."
Melodic stretch refers to tunings with fundamentals stretched relative to each other, while harmonic stretch refers to tunings with harmonics stretched relative to fundamentals which are not stretched. For example, the piano features both stretched harmonics and, to accommodate those, stretched fundamentals.

Centericq is a text mode menu- and window-driven instant messaging interface that supports the ICQ, Yahoo!, AIM, MSN, IRC, XMPP, LiveJournal, and Gadu-Gadu protocols. It allows you to send, receive, and forward messages, URLs, SMSes (both through the ICQ server and email gateways supported by Mirabilis), contacts, and email express messages, and it has many other useful features. Known to work in Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, Windows and macOS/Darwin Operating Systems.
Its heyday was in the first half-decade of the 2000s, with reviews appearing in Softpedia, Czech online magazines ABC Linux and Linux.cz. It was recommended in a 2004 OSNews article on console applications, and in a similar article in the Russian magazine Computerra. Two tutorial articles appeared in the German magazine LinuxUser in 2001 and 2004; the latter article appeared in the English version of Linux Magazine. It was included in a 2002 round-up of ICQ clients in the Russian XAKEP magazine, and in a 2005 round-up review of IRC Clients in Free Software Magazine. The FSM reviewer noted CenterICQ for its windows-like interface built on top of the usual curses library, which provides a lot of information, but can look cluttered on smaller terminal windows, including the standard 80 by 25 terminal. It found that IRC support was "excellent" due to support for multiple servers and channels and the ease of switching between them in the “windowed” interface. In September 2002, Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols found it "the greatest of all console IM clients" due to its "excellent interface and a huge number of features and configuration options" in a category review on Freshmeat. In 2005 it was reviewed in The Unofficial Apple Weblog; despite support for .mac accounts, the reviewer noted "annoying key combos" required to access the menus, because on Mac OS X the usual function key assignments of CenterICQ could not be used. Though he could not access the MSN network, he concluded: "All things considered, I've decided that Centericq is the most stable and intuitive terminal based chat client." 
In August 2007, the project's (then) website stated that CenterICQ development was "dead", and that the website would be shut down in November 2007. The site referred users to the CenterIM fork of the project. The developers of the CenterIM fork applied several security patches and updates. As of  2009, CenterIM was still in development, with version 4.22.9 released on December 14. Neither CenterICQ nor CenterIM 4 support Unicode, but support for UTF-8 is planned for CenterIM 5.

In mathematics, specifically in ring theory, a nilpotent algebra over a commutative ring is an algebra over a commutative ring, in which for some positive integer n every product containing at least n elements of the algebra is zero. The concept of a nilpotent Lie algebra has a different definition, which depends upon the Lie bracket. (There is no Lie bracket for many algebras over commutative rings; a Lie algebra involves its Lie bracket, whereas, there is no Lie bracket defined in the general case of an algebra over a commutative ring.) Another possible source of confusion in terminology is the quantum nilpotent algebra, a concept related to quantum groups and Hopf algebras.

SimpleText is the native text editor for the Apple classic Mac OS. SimpleText allows editing including text formatting (underline, italic, bold, etc.), fonts, and sizes.  It was developed to integrate the features included in the different versions of TeachText that were created by various software development groups within Apple.It can be considered similar to Windows' WordPad application. In later versions it also gained additional read only display capabilities for PICT files, as well as other Mac OS built-in formats like Quickdraw GX and QTIF, 3DMF and even QuickTime movies. SimpleText can even record short sound samples and, using Apple's PlainTalk speech system, read out text in English. Users who wanted to add sounds longer than 24 seconds, however, needed to use a separate program to create the sound and then paste the desired sound into the document using ResEdit.SimpleText superseded TeachText, which was included in System Software up until Mac OS 8. The need for SimpleText arose after Apple stopped bundling MacWrite, to ensure that every user could open and read Readme documents.
The key improvement between SimpleText and TeachText was the addition of text styling. SimpleText could support multiple fonts and font sizes, while TeachText supported only a single font per document. Adding text styling features made SimpleText WorldScript-savvy, meaning that it can use Simplified and Traditional Chinese characters. Like TeachText, SimpleText was also limited to only 32 kB of text in a document, although images could increase the total file size beyond this limit. SimpleText style information was stored in the file's resource fork in such a way that if the resource fork was stripped (such as by uploading to a non-Macintosh server), the text information would be retained.
In Mac OS X, SimpleText is replaced by the more powerful TextEdit application, which reads and writes more document formats as well as including word processor-like features such as a ruler and spell checking. TextEdit's styled text format is RTF, which is able to survive a single-forked file system intact.

Apple has released the source code for a Carbon version of SimpleText in the Mac OS X Panther Developer Tools. If the Developer Tools are installed, it can be found at /Developer/Examples/Carbon/SimpleText.

MUSIC-N refers to a family of computer music programs and programming languages descended from or influenced by MUSIC, a program written by Max Mathews in 1957 at Bell Labs. MUSIC was the first computer program for generating digital audio waveforms through direct synthesis. It was one of the first programs for making music (in actuality, sound) on a digital computer, and was certainly the first program to gain wide acceptance in the music research community as viable for that task. The world's first computer-controlled music was generated in Australia by programmer Geoff Hill on the CSIRAC computer which was designed and built by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard. However, CSIRAC produced sound by sending raw pulses to the speaker, it did not produce standard digital audio with PCM samples, like the MUSIC-series of programs.

Known as "Bim the Button Man" after the 1896 Republican National Convention, he made his fortune selling campaign buttons and built five theatres: West End Theatre (New York), the Yorkville Theatre in Harlem, New York, the Colonial Theatre (New York), the Astor Theatre and the Stuyvestant Theatre (which later became known as the Belasco Theatre). He was found dead in his bed at the Zenobia building after a bout of tonsilitis. The New York Times compared his theatre building, though short-lived, to Oscar Hammerstein I's.
A heavyset redhead, Bim used personal connections to help prognosticate the outcome of elections. His brother Edward Bimberg was the proprietor of the Palm Garden on 52nd Street after a career on the vaudeville stage.

The National Alliance of the Left (Spanish: Alianza de Izquierda Nacional, ALIN) was a left-wing political party in Bolivia.
It was founded in May 1973 by ex-President General Juan José Torres and Major Rubén Sánchez Valdivia.
In an effort to reintegrate the Bolivian resistance with the concrete struggles of the Bolivian masses, Torres and Sánchez Valdivia, with the support of the Bolivian Workers' Center, organized the ALIN as a new movement of national resistance patterned on the Argentine experience. With its headquarters in Buenos Aires, the ALIN reached an agreement in January 1974 with the powerful National Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia (CNTCB). The ALIN promised to give the peasants a greater role in the management of Bolivia's economic and political affairs, in return for peasant support of the ALIN's program of national liberation and peasant recognition of Juan José Torres as the supreme conductor of the Bolivian resistance.
It consisted of a small group of revolutionary militants 
and had the backing of the organization of young Bolivian army officers in exile.
In 1978 and 1979 the Alliance of the National Left took part in an electoral coalition Democratic and Popular Union backing Hernán Siles Zuazo.
For the 1980 elections, the ALIN was the component of the Democratic Revolutionary Front-New Alternative, with Luis Adolfo Siles Salinas as the coalition's presidential candidate.

After the coup d'état on 17 July 1980 the Alliance of the National Left disappeared.

George Pal's Puppetoons were a series of animated puppet films made in Europe in the 1930s and in the U.S. in the 1940s. They are memorable for their use of replacement animation: using a series of different hand-carved wooden puppets (or puppet heads or limbs) for each frame in which the puppet moves or changes expression, rather than moving a single puppet, as is the case with most stop motion puppet animation.
The series began when Pal made an advertising film using "dancing" cigarettes in 1932, which led to a series of theatrical advertising shorts for Philips Radio in the Netherlands. This was followed by a series for Horlicks Malted Milk in England. These shorts have an art deco design, often reducing characters to simple geometric shapes. A typical Puppetoon required 9,000 individually carved and machined wooden figures or parts.
Pal came to the U.S. in 1940, and produced dozens of Puppetoons for Paramount Pictures, eight of which received Academy Award nominations, including Rhythm in the Ranks (for the year 1941), Tulips Shall Grow (1942), Jasper and the Haunted House (1942), The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins (1943), And To Think I Saw it On Mulberry Street (1944), Jasper and the Beanstalk (1945), John Henry and the Inky-Poo (1946), Jasper in a Jam (1946), and Tubby the Tuba (1947).  (Info source:  AMPAS Animated Short Film Oscar archives.)
The series ended due to rising production costs which had increased from 18,000 dollars per short in 1939 to almost 50,000 dollars following the war. Paramount Pictures, Pal's distributor, objected to the cost. Per their suggestion Pal went to produce sequences for feature films. In 1956, the Puppetoons as well as most of Paramount's shorts, were sold to television distributor U.M. & M. TV Corporation. National Telefilm Associates bought out U.M. & M. and continued to syndicate them in the 1950s and 1960s as "Madcap Models".
Pal also used the Puppetoon name and the general Puppetoon technique for miniature puppet characters in some of his live-action feature films, including The Great Rupert (1949), Tom Thumb (1958), and The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm (1963). In these films, the individual wooden figures were billed as The Puppetoons.

In 1986, film producer-director-archivist Arnold Lebovit, a friend of George Pal, collected several Puppetoons and released them theatrically and to video as The Puppetoon Movie reintroducing them to contemporary audiences.  A feature length documentary on the life and films of George Pal followed.

Grigol Lordkipanidze (Georgian: გრიგოლ ლორთქიფანიძე) (September 2, 1881- September 2, 1937) was a Georgian politician and author.
During the Russian Revolution of 1917, he was involved in the Georgian independence movement. From 1919 to 1921, he served as a Minister of Education and then as a Defense Minister in the government of Noe Zhordania, a Menshevik leader of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. After the Soviet invasion of Georgia in 1921, he did not follow his fellow ministers into emigration and chose to stay in Georgia. Despite an amnesty granted by the newly established Bolshevik regime, he was arrested in May 1921, and deported to Suzdal where he composed his historical essay “Thoughts on Georgia” (“ფიქრები საქართველოზე”, 1922-1924). In 1925, he was moved to Kursk, where he was involved in educational activities and edited a local newspaper. In 1928, the Soviet authorities allowed him to return to Georgia and even consulted him on local affairs. Lordkipanidze, however, started to overtly criticize the forcible collectivization and the creation of the highly unpopular Transcaucasian SFSR in which the Georgian SSR was merged with Armenian SSR and Azerbaijan SSR. As a result, he was rearrested and redeported from Georgia. In 1929, he congratulated Joseph Stalin whose jubilee was pompously celebrated throughout the Soviet Union. The letter sent to the Soviet leader also contained harsh criticism of Stalin’s policies, and hence he was rearrested and exiled to Siberia. During the 1937 Great Purges, he was summoned by Lavrenti Beria to Tbilisi to be interrogated as a "politically unreliable person". During the examination, he was subjected to extensive tortures and died on September 2, 1937. Lordkipanidze’s family learned of his death only in the late 1950s, but the place of his burial remains unknown to this day.

David Krech (March 27, 1909 – July 14, 1977) was a Russian-born American experimental and social psychologist who lectured predominately at the University of California, Berkeley. Throughout his education and career endeavors, Krech was influenced by and collaborated with many psychologists including Edward Tolman, Karl Lashley, and Rensis Likert.Krech was born as Yitzhok-Eizik Krechevsky, but changed his name to Isadore Krechevsky upon emigration to the United States in 1913. His name was changed to David Krech in 1943 when he married Hilda Sidney Gruenberg. He did this because he did not want his future son(s) to be labeled with a Jewish name that had held him back in both academic and career pursuits.
Krech extensively researched rats in several university laboratories and found evidence that supported the localization theory of the brain. Later in his career, Krech became interested in the topic of Social Psychology which led him to publishing Theory and Problems of Social Psychology in 1948 with Richard S. Crutchfield (revised into Individual in Society, 1962). Krech also lectured at many universities on the topic of Social Psychology, Experimental Psychology, and others. Because of his involvement in Social Psychology, Krech was appointed by Thurgood Marshall to give expert testimony in the Briggs vs. Elliot court case regarding the "Separate but equal" law. This was the first federal court case that allowed a social psychologist to provide expert testimony. Toward the end of his research career, Krech collaborated with Melvin Calvin, Edward L. Bennett, and Mark R. Rosenzweig to research the relationship between brain chemistry and behavior in rats.

The End of History and the Last Man is a 1992 book by Francis Fukuyama, expanding on his 1989 essay "The End of History?", published in the international affairs journal The National Interest. In the book, Fukuyama argues that the advent of Western liberal democracy may signal the endpoint of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the final form of human government.

What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of post-war history, but the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.
Fukuyama's position contradicts that of Karl Marx, who predicted that communism would displace capitalism. Fukuyama himself identifies on some level with Marx, but more strongly with the German philosopher Hegel, by way of Alexandre Kojève. Kojève argued that the progress of history must lead toward the establishment of a "universal and homogenous" state, most likely incorporating elements of liberal or social democracy; but Kojeve's emphasis on the necessarily "post-political" character of such a state (and its citizens) makes such comparisons inadequate, and is irreducible to any mere "triumph" of capitalism.

Carlo Cattàneo (31 October 1911, San Giorgio Piacentino – 7 March 1979, Rome) was an Italian academic and one of the general relativity theorists and mathematical physicists in the 1960s and 1970s. He made contributions to general relativity theory, fluid mechanics, and elasticity theory.After secondary and university studies in Rome, Cattaneo received a laurea (PhD) in civil engineering in 1934 and a laurea (PhD) in mathematics in 1936 from the University of Rome. In 1938 he was appointed an assistant and in 1940 a docent at the University of Rome. From 1949 to 1957 he was a professor at the University of Pisa. In 1957 he was appointed a professor at the University of Rome, where he worked under the guidance of Tullio Levi-Civita. Cattaneo remained a professor at the University of Rome for the rest of his life.
Cattaneo was the author of introductory textbooks on classical mechanics, fluid mechanics and the theory of relativity. His textbooks were widely used in Italy and made him known as an author or co-author of the best known college textbooks in the field of mathematical physics in Italy.
Catteneo also appears to have been the first to develop a hyperbolic model for heat conduction in 1948. The resulting constitutive equation relating the heat flux and its time rate of change to the temperature gradient has become known as the "Maxwell–Catteneo law" due to the fact that James Clerk Maxwell suggested a similar relation in 1867.
From 1972 to 1976 Cattaneo was vice-president of the Comitato Nazionale della Matematica (National Committee of Mathematics) of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (National Research Council) of Italy. He was elected a member of the International Committee on General Relativity in 1962. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Lille and was elected a member of the Accademia dei Lincei. His doctoral studients include Carlos Aragone.

Zipporah Noisey Nawa (1 March 1945 – 5 November 2007) was a South African teacher, politician and Member of Parliament.
Zipporah Nawa was born on 1 March 1945 in the rural village of Walmansthal in Pretoria. She received her teaching training education at Emmarentia Teachers College in Bela-Bela, Limpopo Province. She taught for a while in Hammanskraal and Pankop (Masube) areas until she left for Louis Trichardt (Makhado) to teach at a local school. In between teaching, she became active in the liberation struggle in the area, carrying out ANC underground work.
She returned home home to Hammanskraal to find out the area had become part of the newly established Bophuthatswana government that did not allow multi-party democratic participation in parliament and civic life. As a result, she was forced to join the Bophuthatswana Teachers Union, but secretly continued to carry on with her ANC underground operations with the likes of the local second-hand furniture shop dealer Mr Deboy Mokoena. Together, they established underground MK cells around Hammanskraal. Among some of the people they recruited into the cells were Mokoena's son, Dithupe, otherwise known by his nom de guerre as Stix after he had skipped the country. There was also Monageng Patrick Xoliso Mmakou who later died on 4 June 1980 in Swaziland in a bomblast orchestrated by the South African security forces. Mr Mokoena recruited and handled Mr Patrick Bapela, aka Raymond Mogale, who was incidentally related to Zipporah Nawa. Bapela recruited her eldest son, Lebogang Lance, into MK activities. These included reconnaissance work around the forest that separated Marokolong village and the White suburb called Renstown. In the forest were bunkers which were used as hideout by the Stinkwater-based Benjamin Moloise and the "Moroka Three" combatants (Simon Mogoerane, Jerry Mosololi and Marcus Motaung) for their mission to attack the Hammanskraal-based South African Police Training college. Arms, ammunition and political literature were hidden here for local MK operatives to courier to various destinations. Crash courses in handling and discharging of weapons and explosives for the local recruits were also conducted inside the bunkers. Zipporah later relocated her son to Eersterust near Mamelodi to avoid harassment from the Bophuthatswana police. But he continued with his political activities there.
Zipporah cladenstinely took part in various community activities, including the anti-Bophuthatswana campaign between 1980 and 1990 when eventually led to its collapse. After the collapse of Bophuthatswana government, which allowed for free political activities, Zipporah joined the South African Democratic Teachers Union - SADTU and became a branch executive committee member, as well as became part of other civic structures in the North West Province. When the African National Congress was unbanned together with other anti-apartheid organisation in 1990, Nawa became involved in structures of the organisation, including those of the ANC Women’s League in the North West province. She held a number of positions within both the ANC and the ANCWL, including those of secretary, deputy secretary and ex officio of various branches of the ANCWL. Nawa also served as an executive committee member of the ANCWL Eastern Region and as a member of the Gender Commission in the North West.She also rose in her teaching profession. She became a school principal at Lefofa Primary School from 1993 and held to the position for 13 years before she resigned to become a Member of Parliament (MP) in July 2006, where she served in the portfolio committee on Correctional Services and her constituency of Moretele. She was also a, fine artist, mathematician and excellent cook. Her colleague, the late Dr Molefi Paul Sefularo used to describe her as a "beaut" and "lover of fine cloth" (good dresser).
Zipporah Nawa died in 2007 and was buried at Marokolong cemeteries. At the time of her death, she had just completed building a house within the Royal Kraal of the Baphuting-Ba-Ga-Nawa in Lebotloane village in Moretele, North West Province.

She left behind two sons and a daughter.

On punched tape, the character is represented with no holes at all, so a new unpunched tape is initially filled with null characters, and often text could be "inserted" at a reserved space of null characters by punching the new characters into the tape over the nulls.

Today the character has much more significance in C and its derivatives and in many data formats, where it serves as a reserved character used to signify the end of a string, often called a null-terminated string. This allows the string to be any length with only the overhead of one byte; the alternative of storing a count requires either a string length limit of 255 or an overhead of more than one byte (there are other advantages/disadvantages described under null-terminated string).

The French demonstration of 15 May 1848 was an event played out, mostly, in the streets of Paris. It was intended to reverse the results of a Second-Republic election of deputies to the Constituent Assembly. It is difficult to say, with any precision, whether this phenomenon should be called a demonstration, a riot, an invasion, or an attempted coup d'état. Nonetheless, it seems to have been largely unplanned, not particularly bloody, and indisputably a failure.

The attacker entered the headquarters of the Kazakhstani security services in the oblast and set off a suicide bomb, killing himself and injuring two others. Initially, the bombing was blamed on "organized crime" in what was considered the first mafia-related suicide bombing in history.

The attack marked the opening of a violent summer in Kazakhstan's west, during which multiple attacks claimed the lives of a combined 19 people.

Truck Festival is an annual independent music festival in Oxfordshire, England. It was started in 1998 by the Bennett family (including the brothers Robin and Joe of the band Goldrush), who decided that mainstream festivals such as Glastonbury had become too commercial and predictable. It is held in July at Hill Farm in Steventon, which lies between Didcot and Abingdon-on-Thames. The festival also gave birth to the Truck Records label in 1999.
The main stage is constructed from three large flatbed trucks, and a common misperception is that this is where the name of the festival comes from. However in 2007 Robin Bennett wrote on the official Truck website: "Contrary to popular belief, the name Truck actually came from a compilation CD I picked up, 'Ten Trucking Greats', the soundtrack of the movie Convoy."

The Cape Qualified Franchise was the system of non-racial franchise that was adhered to in the Cape Colony, and in the Cape Province in the early years of the Union of South Africa. Qualifications for the right to vote at parliamentary elections were applied equally to all men, regardless of race.
This local system of multi-racial suffrage was later gradually restricted, and eventually abolished, under various National Party and United Party governments. In 1930 white women were enfranchised, and in 1931 property qualifications for white voters were removed. In 1936 black voters were then removed from the common voters' rolls and allowed only to elect separate members in 1936, and subsequently denied all representation in the House of Assembly in 1960. Coloured voters similarly followed in 1958 and 1970, respectively.

The Social Democratic Party secured the largest number of seats once again; although it lost seven seats, its percent share of the seats remained constant.  Despite the reduction in the size of the legislature, the populist Swiss People's Party and Green Party both managed to gain seats.
The main losers were the two classical liberal parties, the Free Democrats and Liberals, who lost 15 and 11 seats respectively, reducing them from 42% of seats between them to 33%.  The far left À gauche toute! lost most of its seats.  The Christian Democrats, Green Liberals, and Federal Democratic Union formed a heterogeneous centrist alliance called 'Alliance of the Centre', which won seven seats.

Join, or Die  is a well-known political cartoon, drawn by Benjamin Franklin and first published in his Pennsylvania Gazette on May 9, 1754. The original publication by the Gazette is the earliest known pictorial representation of colonial union produced by a British colonist in America. It is a woodcut showing a snake cut into eighths, with each segment labeled with the initials of one of the American colonies or regions. New England was represented as one segment, rather than the four colonies it was at that time. Delaware was not listed separately as it was part of Pennsylvania. Georgia, however, was omitted completely. Thus, it has eight segments of snake rather than the traditional 13 colonies. The two northernmost British American colonies at the time, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, were not represented, nor were any British Caribbean possessions. The cartoon appeared along with Franklin's editorial about the "disunited state" of the colonies, and helped make his point about the importance of colonial unity.  This cartoon was used in the French and Indian War to symbolize that the colonies needed to join together with the Kingdom of Great Britain to defeat the French and Indians.  It became a symbol of colonial freedom during the American Revolutionary War.

Free state is a term occasionally used in the official titles of some states. 
In principle the title asserts and emphasises the freedom of the state in question, but what this actually means varies greatly in different contexts:

Sometimes it asserts sovereignty or independence (and with that, lack of foreign domination).
Sometimes it asserts autonomy within a larger nation-state.
Sometimes  it is used as a synonym for republic but not all "free states" have been republics. While the historical German free states and the Orange Free State were republican in form, the Congo and Irish Free States were governed under forms of monarchy. The republican sense derives from libera res publica (literally, "free state")', a term used by Roman historians for the period of the Roman republic.

Ondine is a ballet in three acts created by the choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton and composer Hans Werner Henze. Ashton originally produced Ondine for the Royal Ballet in 1958, with Henze commissioned to produce the original score, published as Undine, which has since been restaged by other choreographers. The ballet was adapted from a novella called Undine by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué and it tells the tale of a water nymph who is the object of desire of a young prince named Palemon. The première of the ballet took place at the Royal Opera House, London, on 27 October 1958, with the composer as guest conductor. The first major revival of this Ashton/Henze production took place in 1988.

Monoculturalism is the practice of actively preserving a national culture via the exclusion of external influences. Japan, China, South Korea, and North Korea are examples of monoculturalism. Usually a monocultural society exists by racial homogeneity, nationalistic tendencies, geographic isolation, or political isolation (sometimes but not always under a totalitarian regime).
Recently, right-wing governments in several European states, notably the Netherlands and Denmark, have reversed the national policy and returned to an official monoculturalism. A similar reversal is the subject of debate in the United Kingdom and others, due to evidence of incipient segregation and anxieties over homegrown terrorism.
Several heads-of-government have expressed doubts about the success of multicultural policies: British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, former Australian Prime Minister John Howard, former Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar, and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy have voiced concerns about the effectiveness of their multicultural policies for integrating immigrants.
Nazi Germany practiced monoculturalism as part of its campaign for Pan-Germanism and German nationalism, but monoculturalism was typical of the era and many European countries were monocultural at that time. Some European countries are still effectively monocultural because of he people's shared culture and ethnicity, like Finland.

Green-Fascism is the jargon used mainly by Turkish Kemalist intellectuals and political writers to define and criticise theocratic Islamist political regimes and counter-revolutionary movements which attempt to transform the secular State into a religious State as in Iran, Saudi-Arabia, Algeria, and Sudan. Green is a widely used color on Islamic tombs and mosques. It is the color of the cloth covering the coffins in funerals, so it is known as the color of Islam.
Political Islam is referred to as "green-fascism" and conceived of as a form of fascism mainly because of the consolidation of the Ottoman Monarch's ideological hegemony after the adoption of the Caliphate by Ottoman Emperor Yavuz Sultan Selim in 1517 ACE. Yavuz Sultan Selim, after becoming Caliph, killed thousands of Turcomans from sects other than the Sunnis, in Asia Minor.

) is a well-known Christmas carol composed by Adolphe Adam in 1847 to the French poem "Minuit, chrétiens" (Midnight, Christians) by a wine merchant and poet, Placide Cappeau (1808–1877).
In Roquemaure at the end of the year 1843, the church organ was recently renovated. To celebrate the event, the parish priest asked Cappeau, native from this town, to write a Christmas poem, even though the latter never showed an interest in religion, and Cappeau obliged.Soon after, Adam wrote the music. The song was premiered in Roquemaure in 1847 by the opera singer Emily Laurey.

Unitarian minister John Sullivan Dwight, editor of Dwight's Journal of Music, created a singing edition based on Cappeau's French text in 1855. In both the French original and in the two familiar English versions of the carol, as well as many other languages, the text reflects on the birth of Jesus and of humanity's redemption.

Formed after Higgins met Miranda Cooper, Xenomania has written and produced for renowned artists such as Cher, Kylie Minogue, Dannii Minogue, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Pet Shop Boys, The Saturdays and the Sugababes. In particular, all but one of Girls Aloud's studio albums have been entirely written and produced by Xenomania.  The Sugababes' "Round Round" and Girls Aloud's "Sound of the Underground"  have been credited with reshaping British pop music for the 2000s. Gabriella Cilmi's "Sweet About Me" and Girls Aloud's "The Promise" were named Best Single at the ARIA Music Awards of 2009 and the 2009 BRIT Awards, respectively.The team has been referred to as "a Phil Spector" and "a Motown of the 21st-century". Higgins himself has said that Xenomania aspires to be a modern-day version of RAK Records. Of Higgins and Xenomania, Girls Aloud's former manager Louis Walsh says, "He just makes great songs for radio. They just jump out at you and stay in your brain." There are wide influences present in their productions, including electronic, glam rock, Motown soul, punk, and more traditional pop music. The name "Xenomania" means, according to Higgins, "the exact opposite of Xenophobia [...] a love of everything, of all cultures." Current members of the Xenomania writing and production team are Higgins and Cooper.  Long term members Tim Powell and Nick Coler left in 2010. There is also a Xenomania house band who work on potential backing tracks; members include Florrie Arnold, Kieran Jones, and Jason Resch. Parisian remixer Fred Falke also frequently works with Xenomania.
Xenomania started a "record label" of the same name in 2008, developing artists and working on material before looking for major label deals. Artists include Alex Gardner, Jessie Malakouti, Brooke X, Mini Viva, and Vagabond.

The Red Line Agreement is the name given to an agreement signed by partners in the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC) on July 31, 1928. The aim of the agreement was to formalize the corporate structure of TPC and bind all partners to a "self-denial clause" that prohibited any of its shareholders from independently seeking oil interests in the ex-Ottoman territory. It marked the creation of an oil monopoly, or cartel, of immense influence, spanning a vast territory. The cartel preceded easily by three decades the birth of another cartel, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which was formed in 1960.
It has been said that, at a meeting in 1928, Calouste Gulbenkian, an Armenian businessman and philanthropist, drew a red line on a map of the Middle East demarcating the boundaries of the area where the self-denial clause would be in effect. Gulbenkian said this was the boundary of the Ottoman Empire he knew in 1914. He should know, he added, because he was born in it and lived in it. The other partners looked on it attentively and did not object. They had already anticipated such a boundary. (According to some accounts, the “red line” was not drawn by Gulbenkian but by a French representative.) Except for Gulbenkian, the partners were the supermajors of today. Within the “red line” lie the entire ex-Ottoman territory in the Middle East including the Arabian Peninsula (plus Turkey) but excluding Kuwait. Kuwait was excluded as it was meant to be a preserve for the British.
Years later, Walter C. Teagle of Standard Oil of New Jersey remarked that the agreement was “a damn bad move”. However, it served to define the sphere of operations of TPC's successor, the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC). The writer Stephen Hemsley Longrigg, a former IPC employee, noted that "the Red Line Agreement, variously assessed as a sad case of wrongful cartelization or as an enlightened example of international co‑operation and fair-sharing, was to hold the field for twenty years and in large measure determined the pattern and tempo of oil development over a large part of the Middle East". Apart from
Saudi Arabia and Bahrain where ARAMCO and BAPCO prevailed, IPC monopolized oil exploration inside the Red Line during this period.

American oil companies Standard Oil of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum were partners in IPC and therefore bound by the Red Line Agreement.  When they were offered a partnership with ARAMCO to develop the oil resources of Saudi Arabia, their partners in IPC refused to release them from the Agreement. After the Americans claimed that World War II had ended the Red Line Agreement, protracted legal proceedings with Gulbenkian followed. Eventually the case was settled out of court and the American partners were allowed to join ARAMCO. The Red Line Agreement became a legacy document after this date, as IPC continued to operate  existing concessions under its terms but the shareholder companies were allowed independently to seek new oil concessions across the Middle East.

A software appliance is a software application that might be combined with just enough operating system (JeOS) for it to run optimally on industry standard hardware (typically a server) or in a virtual machine. In essence the term software appliance is designating the software distribution or the firmware that is running a computer appliance.Virtual appliances are a subset of software appliances. The main distinction is the packaging format and the specificity of the target platform. A virtual appliance is a virtual machine image designed to run on a specific virtualization platform, while a software appliance is often packaged in more generally applicable image format (e.g., Live CD) that supports installations to physical machines and multiple types of virtual machines.
Installing a software appliance to a virtual machine and packaging that into an image, creates a virtual appliance.

The Liouville function, denoted by λ(n) and named after Joseph Liouville, is an important function in number theory.
If n is a positive integer, then λ(n) is defined as:

<math>\lambda(n) = (-1)^{\Omega(n)},\,\! </math>where Ω(n) is the number of prime factors of n, counted with multiplicity (sequence A008836 in the OEIS).
λ is completely multiplicative since Ω(n) is completely additive, i.e.: Ω(ab) = Ω(a) + Ω(b). The number 1 has no prime factors, so Ω(1) = 0 and therefore λ(1) = 1. The Liouville function satisfies the identity:

<math>\sum_{d|n}\lambda(d) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if }n\text{ is a perfect square,} \\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
</math>
The Liouville function's Dirichlet inverse is the absolute value of the Möbius function.

Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify  named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.
Most research on NER systems has been structured as taking an unannotated block of text, such as this one:

Jim bought 300 shares of Acme Corp. in 2006.And producing an annotated block of text that highlights the names of entities:

[Jim]Person bought 300 shares of [Acme Corp.]Organization in [2006]Time.In this example, a person name consisting of one token, a two-token company name and a temporal expression have been detected and classified.

State-of-the-art NER systems for English produce near-human performance. For example, the best system entering MUC-7 scored 93.39% of F-measure while human annotators scored 97.60% and 96.95%.

In 2010, Kaggle was founded as a platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions on which companies and researchers post their data and  statisticians and data miners from all over the world compete to produce the best models. This crowdsourcing approach relies on the fact that there are countless strategies that can be applied to any predictive modelling task and it is impossible to know at the outset which technique or analyst will be most effective. Kaggle also hosts recruiting competitions in which data scientists compete for a chance to interview at leading data science companies like Facebook, Winton Capital, and Walmart.

In April 2015, Kaggle released the first version of their Scripts product onto their platform. Scripts allows users to write, run, and publicly share their code on Kaggle. In January 2016, Kaggle released their Datasets product, making a selection of public datasets available on Kaggle. Each datasets has Scripts enabled, as well as a dedicated forum, allowing for conversation and collaboration between data scientists and the work they are doing on each dataset. On 8 July 2016, Kaggle renamed its Scripts product to Kernels.

In the politics of the United States, social conservatism is a conservative ideology that advocates against social progressivism, centered on the preservation of traditional beliefs. The accepted aims of the movement often vary amongst the various organisations it comprises, making it hard to generalise about the ideological preferences of its professed adherents. There are, however, a number of general principles to which at least a majority of social conservatives adhere, such as the rejection of the sexual revolution, abortion, LGBT rights and feminism.

The Principality of Galilee was one of the four major seigneuries of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, according to 13th-century commentator John of Ibelin. The direct holdings of the principality were around Tiberias, in Galilee proper, but with all its vassals, the lordship covered all Galilee and southern Phoenicia (today Lebanon). The lordship of Galilee had a disproportionate number of sub-vassals. The independent Sidon was located between Galilee's holdings. There are reasons to doubt Galilee's position as overlord of some of those.
The principality was established, at least in name, in 1099 when Tancred was given Tiberias, Haifa, and Bethsan by Godfrey of Bouillon. In 1101 Baldwin I limited Tancred's power by giving Haifa to Galdemar Carpenel, and Tancred was forced to give up the principality and become regent in Antioch. The principality became the fief of the families of St. Omer, Montfaucon (Falcomberques), and then Bures, and its main seat was in Tiberias; thus it was sometimes also called the Principality of Tiberias or the Tiberiad. The Principality was destroyed by Saladin in 1187, although the title was used as dignity by relatives and younger sons of the kings of Cyprus (the titular kings of Jerusalem) afterwards.
The Principality also had its own vassals: the Lordships of Beirut, Nazareth, and Haifa.  Each of these in turn often had their own sub-vassals. Their number and the size and significance of some were disproportionate.

Visualization or visualisation (see spelling differences) is any technique for creating images, diagrams, or animations to communicate a message. Visualization through visual imagery has been an effective way to communicate both abstract and concrete ideas since the dawn of humanity. Examples from history include cave paintings, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Greek geometry, and Leonardo da Vinci's revolutionary methods of technical drawing for engineering and scientific purposes.
Visualization today has ever-expanding applications in science, education, engineering (e.g., product visualization), interactive multimedia, medicine, etc. Typical of a visualization application is the field of computer graphics. The invention of computer graphics may be the most important development in visualization since the invention of central perspective in the Renaissance period. The development of animation also helped advance visualization.

In mathematics, at the intersection of number theory and special functions, Apéry's constant is defined as the number

<math>\zeta(3) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^3} = \lim_{n \to \infty}\left(\frac{1}{1^3} + \frac{1}{2^3} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n^3}\right)</math>where ζ is the Riemann zeta function. It has an approximate value of
ζ(3) =  (sequence A002117 in the OEIS).
This constant arises naturally in a number of physical problems, including in the second- and third-order terms of the electron's gyromagnetic ratio using quantum electrodynamics. It also arises in the analysis of random minimum spanning trees and in conjunction with the gamma function when solving certain integrals involving exponential functions in a quotient which appear occasionally in physics, for instance when evaluating the two-dimensional case of the Debye model and the Stefan–Boltzmann law.

Billie Jean Jones Eshliman Williams Horton Berlin (born August 12, 1933), professionally known as Billie Jean Horton, was a country music performer who was best known for her marriages to country singers Hank Williams and Johnny Horton.
The daughter of a police chief from Bossier City, Louisiana, she was already divorced from a first husband, Harrison Eshliman when she was introduced to Hank by her then boyfriend, country singer Faron Young. They married in October 1952, when she was 19 years old. They first married in a private ceremony in Minden, Louisiana, then repeated their vows before sold-out audiences at two Williams concerts at the Municipal Auditorium in New Orleans.
Williams died from heart failure on New Year's Day 1953. Late that same year, she married country singer Johnny Horton and became important in promoting his career. Horton died in an automobile accident in 1960, widowing her a second time.  She then worked as a recording artist, with her record "Ocean of Tears" hitting the country top 40 in 1961, and had a relationship with Johnny Cash (then still married to his first wife, Vivian Liberto).  Later she married and divorced a fourth husband, insurance executive Kent Berlin. In 1971 a federal court ruled that, despite the fact that her first divorce (from Eshliman) might not have been final before her wedding with Williams, she had married Williams in good faith and their marriage was entitled to a presumption of validity.  She became known for her energetic efforts on behalf of the reputations and estates of both of her famous husbands.

In 1925 Rezā Pahlavi was appointed as the legal monarch of Iran by decision of Iran's constituent assembly. The assembly deposed Ahmad Shah Qajar, the last Shah of the Qajar dynasty, and selected Reza Shah and Pahlavi dynasty instead, by amending the Iran's 1906 constitution. Reza Shah was the first democratically elected monarch of Iran. He founded the Pahlavi dynasty. He established a constitutional monarchy that lasted until overthrown in 1979 during the Iranian Revolution. Reza Shah introduced many social, economic, and political reforms during his reign, ultimately laying the foundation of the modern Iranian state.

His legacy remains controversial to this day: his defenders assert that he was an essential modernizing force for Iran (whose international prominence had sharply declined during Qajar rule), while his detractors assert that his reign was often despotic, with his failure to modernize Iran's large peasant population eventually sowing the seeds for the Iranian Revolution. Moreover, his insistence on ethnic nationalism and cultural unitarism along with forced detribalization and sedentarization resulted in suppression of several ethnic and social groups.

The steel-string acoustic guitar is a modern form of guitar that descends from the classical guitar, but is strung with steel strings for a brighter, louder sound. It is often referred to simply as an acoustic guitar, though the nylon-strung classical guitar is also sometimes called an acoustic guitar.
The most common type is often called a flat top guitar, to distinguish it from the more specialized archtop guitar and other variations.
The standard tuning for an acoustic guitar is E-A-D-G-B-E (low to high), although many players, particularly fingerpickers, use alternate tunings (scordatura), such as "open G" (D-G-D-G-B-D), "open D" (D-A-D-F♯-A-D), or "drop D" (D-A-D-G-B-E).

The screenplay and story, written by Richard Carr, was based on a portion of the 1947 novel, The Perfect Round, by Henry Morton Robinson.

In each of the 21 territories that the album was released, it was given its own track listing, based upon which songs were most popular locally. In a number of countries, there were two versions – a single-disc version, and a double-disc version. All in all 63 tracks appear in at least one of the 20 different versions. The country the edition came from can be identified by a small national flag on the spine, except for the Argentine/Mexican, Eastern European and UK editions, which are "flag-less".
All the tracks are digitally remastered either from 1999 or, for the single edits, 2002, with the exception of "Under Pressure", which is also at a lower volume than the rest of the disc.
A DVD version of the compilation was also released, containing 47 videos and live performances as well as alternate versions and easter eggs. Some of the videos on this collection, notably "China Girl", "Loving the Alien" and "Day-In Day-Out" are the censored versions of the original videos.
Initially peaking at number 11 in October 2002 on the UK Albums Chart, the album entered the top 10 for the first time in January 2016, following Bowie's death, and reached a new peak of number 1. It also became the first album to reach number 1 on the Official Charts due to streaming.

Public works (or internal improvements historically in the United States) are a broad category of infrastructure projects, financed and constructed by the government, for recreational, employment, and health and safety uses in the greater community. They include public buildings (municipal buildings, schools, hospitals), transport infrastructure (roads, railroads, bridges, pipelines, canals, ports, airports), public spaces (public squares, parks, beaches), public services (water supply, sewage, electrical grid, dams), and other, usually long-term, physical assets and facilities. Though often interchangeable with public infrastructure and public capital, public works does not necessarily carry an economic component, thereby being a broader term.

Hitman City is a 2003 action-adventure movie that was directed by Scott Shaw.
This feature was filmed in Taipei, Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong, Sedona, Arizona, Hollywood, and Venice, California. This film stars Scott Shaw, Joe Estevez and Kevin Thompson.
Common to all of the films created by Scott Shaw, this feature follows a non-linear storyline.  It details the exploits of an assassin, Jericho Ryder, played by Shaw, who is guided to dispose of those individuals who are inflicting havoc and negativity upon society. This character is guided to his targets by a bizarre set of mystical entities that only Ryder understands to be living beings.
As is also commonly the case with Scott Shaw's Films,  this feature is full of Music video style references and edits where the central characters leave behind the storyline and interact solely by the presentation of visual images in association with Techno music.
This film is considered a "Zen Film" in that it was created in the distinct style of filmmaking formulated by Scott Shaw known as Zen Filmmaking.  In this style of filmmaking no scripts are used.

Led by Harold Nelson, up to 1000 demonstrators marched on Government House at Liberty Square in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia where they burnt an effigy of the Administrator of the Northern Territory, John Gilruth, and demanded his resignation.
Their grievances were against the two main Northern Territory employers, Vestey’s Meatworks and the Commonwealth of Australia, and concerned political representation, unemployment and taxation. Gilruth and his family left Darwin soon afterwards under the protection of HMAS Encounter, while the Vestey company permanently closed its Darwin operations in 1920.

Use value or value in use is the utility of consuming a good—the want-satisfying power of a good or service in classical political economy. In Marx's critique of political economy, any product has a labor-value and a use-value, and if it is traded as a commodity in markets, it additionally has an exchange value, most often expressed as a money-price. Marx acknowledges that commodities being traded also have a general utility, implied by the fact that people want them, but he argues that this by itself tells us nothing about the specific character of the economy in which they are produced and sold.

Jane Addams (September 6, 1860 – May 21, 1935) was a pioneer American settlement activist/reformer, social worker, public philosopher, sociologist, author, and leader in women's suffrage and world peace. She created the first settlement house in the United States, Chicago's Hull House. In an era when presidents such as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson identified themselves as reformers and social activists, Addams was one of the most prominent reformers of the Progressive Era. She helped  America to address and focus on issues that were of concern to mothers, such as the needs of children, local public health, and world peace. She said that if women were to be responsible for cleaning up their communities and making them better places to live, they needed to be able to vote to do so effectively. Addams became a role model for middle-class women who volunteered to uplift their communities. She is increasingly being recognized as a member of the American pragmatist school of philosophy. In 1889 she co-founded Hull House, and in 1920 she was a co-founder for the ACLU. In 1931 she became the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and is recognized as the founder of the social work profession in the United States.

Andrew Ogg (1967) introduced the criterion for elliptic curves. Serre and  Tate (1968) used the results of André Néron (1964) to extend it to abelian varieties,

) was a German social democratic party in Czechoslovakia. It was founded as the Bohemian provincial organization of the Social Democratic Workers Party of Austria separated itself from the mother party. The founding convention was held in Teplice in 30 August – 3 September 1919; the first leader of the party was Josef Seliger.
In the First Czechoslovak Republic, DSAP was the most important German party, which aimed at giving the German people a place in the republic. At first the party's leadership was politically and socially radical; the Czechoslovak State was regarded as a "creation of Allies' Imperialism" and the Czechoslovak Constitution as "suicide of democracy". However, these politics were shortly changed as the radical left-wing led by Karl Kreibich left the party (and joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia) in October 1920. Eventually the number of members fallen dramatically in 1921–1926 from 120,000 to 60,000.Some notable members of the party started talks with President Masaryk who—in vain—tried to persuade the party to join the government. It agreed finally in 1929, when its leader Ludwig Czech became Minister of Public Affairs.
During the years of the great economic crisis, the party lost many of its Sudeten German supporters, and the Sudeten German Party (SdP) gained importance. As after the Munich Agreement the troops of Nazi Germany began occupying the Sudetes areas (on 1 October 1938), only some of the anti-Nazi opposition members could retreat into remaining Czechoslovakian territories. Immediately after the entry of the Nazi troops, the persecution of the Social democrats and other opponents of Nazism began. From October to December 1938, 20,000 members of the Social Democratic Party were arrested; 2,500 Sudeten Germans were sent to the Dachau concentration camp alone. Around 30,000 people managed to flee to the West. On 22 February 1939 the DSAP leadership decided to stop all activities in the territory of the Czechoslovakian Republic and to continue working abroad as "Treuegemeinschaft sudetendeutscher Sozialdemokraten". The group began publishing the monthly bulletin Sudeten-Freiheit from Oslo.
The party was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1923 and 1938.

Post-realism is a theoretical perspective on international relations. According to post-realism, global actors are joined in a global network of thoughts, actions, and talk. Post-realism focuses particularly on the talk, on discourse and debate in the conduct and study of international relations. For post-realists, international realism is a form of social scientific and political rhetoric. It opens rather than closes a debate about what is real and what is realistic in international relations.

Labor-time calculation is a method of economic calculation that uses units of labor time as the basis for accounting and valuation. This method of calculation was advocated by the economists Otto Bauer, Helene Bauer and Otto Leichter as an alternative to calculation in kind.Otto Leichter criticized in-kind calculation on the basis that rational accounting required a general unit for comparing costs of heterogeneous goods.

The basis for labor-time calculation is found in Karl Marx's analysis of value in capitalism. However, Marx was vehemently opposed to any proposal for using labor-time as a basis for socialist calculation because his concept of socially-necessary labor time was specifically intended as a tool for analyzing extant capitalism. In Marx's view, socialism would operate according to its own economic "laws of motion" distinct from those of capitalism.
